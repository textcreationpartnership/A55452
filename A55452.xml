            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the name of the Compiler of the greateſt part of the enſuing REPORTS (for <hi>Denominatio fit a parte majori &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liori)</hi> would be a ſufficient invitation to any underſtanding Reader, not only to caſt his Eye upon, but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to peruſe them; yet becauſe theſe two Queſtions may (and no doubt will, and that upon good ground) be made: as, 1. Why they ſhould lye ſo long in private hands, vvithout being expoſed to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vievv? 2. Why they ſhould be now Printed?</p>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer, That by the handſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and connexion of them, it may (and that very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) be conjectured, that the honourable Compiler at firſt intended them for the publique, but they (after his death) comming into private hands, they who became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of them, did rather intend their owne, and their friends private knowledge and advantage by them, then to let others communicate therein, for it hath not formerly been (neither yet is) a thing unuſuall, for the great and learned Profeſſors of the Law, to ingroſſe into their owne hands the beſt and moſt authentick REPORTS, for their better help, credit, and advantage in the courſe of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, which being unknown to other men, they cannot upon ſudden occaſions, be ready to make anſwer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb facs="tcp:53226:3"/>
and that might be the reaſon why they have not been as yet publiſhed.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that the Copy (out of which this Tranſlation was made) comming out of the Library of a reverend and Learned Sergeant at Law now deceaſed, and ſaid therin to be written with the proper hand-writing of the Lord POPHAM (a good ground to conceive that it was Authentick) the Gentleman in whoſe hands it was, was earneſtly importuned for the Copy that ſo it might be made publique, to whoſe importunity there was at laſt a cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſention, ſo as ſuch due care might be taken both in the Tranſlation and Printing, as not to prejudice the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or the matter therein contained: And whether that condition be fully performed, ſhall be now left to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did interpretation of the judicious Reader, who cannot but know that ſome <hi>Errata's</hi> (let the Printer or Correcter be never ſo carefull) will follow the Preſſe; but it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that nothing materiall or ſubſtantiall is committed or omitted to the prejudice of the Work, or of the Compiler thereof. There is an addition of ſome later Caſes in the time of King JAMES, and the late King CHARLES, which were taken by judicious Pens, as will evidently appear by the Caſes themſelves; and I dare ſay, that whoever reads them, will neither think his Time or Money miſpent, they being ſuch as are well digeſted, and very practicall. I ſhall adde this one thing more, that the principall end of this Edition is, the advancement of knovvledge, and to impart the good thereof to thoſe who heretofore vvanted vvhat is hereby made publick, vvhich may (peradventure) be a means to invite others more learned to publiſh other things of the like nature, for the benefit of Students, and Profeſſors of the Lavv.</p>

for whoſe life it was, was dead, upon which he entred, and it is adjudged that it ſufficeth for the Plaintiff to maintain that <hi>Ceſtuy &amp; vie</hi> was yet living without making any other Title: And yet theſe reaſons <hi>Cleoch</hi> and <hi>Gawdy</hi> held the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication good, to which <hi>Popham</hi> ſayd, that we as Iuſtices ought not to adjudge for the Plaintif where a good &amp; formall bar is pleaded as here it is. But wherby the Record it ſelf which is before us, we cannot ſee that the Plaintiff hath good cauſe of Action: And therefore I agree that in Treſpaſſe in ſome caſes the Plaintiff may traverſe the Bar, or part of it, without making any other Title then that which is acknowledged to the Plaintiff by the Bar, but this alwaies ought to be where a Title is acknowledged to the Plaintiff by the Bar, and by another means deſtroy by the ſame Bar, for there it ſufficeth the Plaintiff to traverſe that part of the Bar which goeth to the deſtruction of the Title of the Plaintiff compriſed in the Bar, without making any other Title, but if hee will traverſe any other part of the Bar, he cannot do it without making an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall Title to himſelf in his Replication, where by the Bar the firſt poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeareth to be in the Defendant, becauſe that although the Traverſe there be found for the Plaintiff, yet notwithſtanding by the Record in ſuch a Caſe the firſt Poſſeſſions will yet appear to be in the Defendant, which ſufficeth to maintain his Regreſſe upon the Plaintiff, and therefore the Court hath no matter before them in ſuch a Caſe to adjudge for the Plaintiff, unleſſe in caſes where the Plaintiff ſhews a ſpeciall Title under the Poſſeſſion of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; As for example, In treſpaſſe for breaking of his Cloſe, the Defendant pleads that <hi>J. G.</hi> was ſeiſed of it in his Demeſne as of fee, and enfeoffed <hi>J. K.</hi> by virtue of which he was ſeiſed accordingly, and ſo being ſeiſed, enfeoffed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant of it, by which he was ſeiſed, untill the Plaintiff claiming by calour of a Deed of Feoffment made by the ſayd <hi>J.

G. to the Plaintiff, which being deſtroyed he cannot enter upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, albeit the Defendant cometh to the Land by Diſſeiſin, and not by the Feoffment of the ſayd I.

G. being traverſed and found for him, he hath by the acknowledgment of the Defendant himſelf a good Title againſt him, by reaſon of the firſt Eſtate at will acknowledged by the Defendant to be to the Plaintiff, and now not defeated: But in the ſame caſe he cannot traverſe the Feoffment ſuppoſed to be made to the ſayd I. K. to the Defendant, without an eſpeciall Title made to himſelf; for albeit that I. K. did not enfeoff the Defendant, but that the Defendant diſſeiſed him, or that he cometh to the Land by another means, yet he hath a good Title againſt the Plaintiff by his firſt Poſſeſſion, not deſtroyed by any Title <hi>Paramount,</hi> by any matter which appeareth by the Record, upon which the Court is to adjudge; and with this accord the opinion of 31 &amp;. 4. 1.

Deviſe,</hi> If a man deviſe Lands to another in Fee, he hath the uſe and Title of it, but if it be limitted to his uſe for his life only, the uſe of the Fee ſhall be to the Heir of the Deviſor, for by the limitation his intent ſhall be taken to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then it ſhould be taken if this limitation had not been; and in as much as in this caſe the Earl reſerves to himſelf but the uſe for years, it is evident that his intent never was to have the Fee, to ſurrender this Term, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he intended to be for the benefit of his will, which ſhall be defeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his purpoſe, if the Fee ſhall be alſo in him by the death of the ſayd <hi>Iohn,</hi> without Iſſue Male, and therefore the ſayd Daughters ought to have the Land. And on the other part it was argued by <hi>Glanvil:</hi> Serjeant, and <hi>Egerton</hi> the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney Generall, that this limitation made to the right Heirs, is void in the ſame manner, as if a man give Lands to another for life, the Remainder to the right Heirs of the Feoffor, in this caſe the Heir ſhall take by deſcent as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion remaining to the Feoffor, and not as a Remainder deveſted out of him, for the ancient right priviledge the Eſtate which he may take, and therfore he ſhall take it by deſcent and not by purchaſe; for the name of right Heir is not a name of purchaſe betwixt the Anceſtor and his heir, becauſe that doth inſtance that he happeneth to be heir, he takes it by deſcent, and then it comes too late to take by purchaſe; And another reaſon that the Daughters ſhall not have it is, becauſe that when Sir <hi>Iohn Ruſſell</hi> dies without Iſſue Male, which Eſtate might have preſerved the Remainder, if it ſhall be a Remainder, there was not any right heir of the ſayd <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> to take this Remainder, becauſe that the ſayd Earl ſurvived him: And therefore it is to bee reſembled to this Caſe; Land is given in Tail, the Remainder to the right Heirs of I. G. the Donee dyes without Iſſue in the life of I. G. in this caſe, albeit I. G. dyes afterwards having an heir, yet this heir ſhall never have the Loud, becauſe he was not heir in <hi>Eſſe</hi> to take it when the Remainder fell, and for the mean Eſtate for years this cannot preſerve a Remainder, no more then when Land is given for years, the Remainder to the right heirs of I. G. this Remainder can never be good if I. G. be then living, becauſe ſuch a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot depend but upon a Free-hold precedent at leaſt, and therefore the Inheritance here ſhall go to the now Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> by the ſecond aſſurance. And upon conſideration of the Caſe and ſeverall Confirmes had upon this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iudges and Barens, it was at laſt reſolved by all (but Baron <hi>Clarke)</hi> that the Daughters ſhall not have the Mannors in the County of <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And at this day they did not think there was any diverſity between the Caſe of a Remainder in Poſſeſſion limitted to the right heir of one, and of a Remainder in uſe ſo limited over to another.</p>

the ſame Land to an eſtranger, yet the Wife ſhall have it and not the Deviſee, as it happened in the Caſe of <hi>Matthew Smith,</hi> who made firſt ſuch a Deviſe of a Term of his Wife, and yet the Wife had it; becauſe that by the death of the husband (before which the Deviſe did not take effect) the wife had it in her firſt Right not altered in the life of her Husband; but it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this caſe by all the Court, that the Leſſee ſhall have it during his Term, for as the husband during his life might contract for the Land for the whole term which the wife had in it, ſo might he do for any part of the term at his pleaſure, for if he may deviſe the Land for one and twenty years to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin preſently, he alſo may make it to begin at any time to come after his Death, if the term of the Wife be not expired, but for the Remainder of the term of the husband, made no diſpoſition during his life, the Wife ſhall have it, which by <hi>Popham</hi> this Caſe happened upon a ſpecialll Verdict in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> about 20 <hi>Eli.</hi> Where he and Sergeant <hi>Baber</hi> were Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers in the Circuit there, to wit, the Lands were demiſed to husband and wife for their lives, the Remainder to the Survivor of them for years, the Husband granted over this term of years and dyed, and the queſtion was whether the Wife ſhall have the term of years or the Grantee, and adjudged that the Wife ſhall have it, and it was upon this reaſon, becauſe there was nothing in the one or the other to grant over, untill there was a Survivor: And the ſame Law had been if the Wife bad dyed after the Grant, and the Husband had ſurvived, yet he ſhall have the term againſt his own Grant; as if a Leaſe were made for Life, the Remainder for years to him which firſt cometh to <hi>Pauls,</hi> if <hi>A.</hi> grant this Term for years to another, and afterwards <hi>A.</hi> is the firſt which commeth to <hi>Pauls,</hi> yet the Grantee ſhall not have this Term becauſe it was not in <hi>A.</hi> by any means neither in Intereſt nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe untill he came to <hi>Pauls:</hi> As if a man make a Leaſe for life, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the Right heirs of <hi>J.

               <p>And here <hi>Standiſh</hi> before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> next after the ſecond Leaſe made to him could not grant over his firſt term to be good to the Grantee, for if this ſhould be, the ſecond term ſhall not be good to <hi>Standiſh;</hi> but for the remnant of the years after, the firſt term finiſhed, which cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtandeth in the power of the Grantor with the aſſent and acceptance of the Grantee to make the ſecond Grant good, for the whole term, to wit, from <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and this cannot be but by a determination in Law of the firſt term immediatly, which is made by his own acceptance, and therefore a prejudice to none but himſelf, and <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> and the firſt Term cannot have his continuance untill <hi>Mich.</hi> but is gone preſently by the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſecond Leaſe in the whole, for the firſt contract which was entyre cannot be ſo diſſolved in part, but in the whole, as to that which the party hath, and therefore the firſt Term (as the caſe is here) is gone in the whole, to which <hi>Clench</hi> and <hi>Gaudy</hi> agreed: And if ſo then this laſt Leaſe to <hi>Standiſh</hi> was but as a Leaſe made to begin at a time to come, which is made good by the Stat. of 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> if it do not exceed the time of 40 years from the making of the Leaſe; for the purpoſe of this Act was, that <hi>Colledges</hi> and the like ſhall not make Grants in Reverſion, albeit it be for a year, and the reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by ſuch Grants in Reverſion they ſhall be excluded to have their Rent of the particular Tenants for the time: And therfore in the caſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who had a Ioynture aſſured to her for her life by Act of Parliament, with a Proviſe, that the Earle her Husband might demiſe it for one and twenty yeares, rendring the uſuall Rent, where the ſayd Earle had made a Leaſe for one and twentie yeares, according to the Statute, within a yeare before the end of the ſame Leaſe, the ſaid Earle made a new Leaſe of the ſame Land to <hi>Wroth</hi> his Servant for one and twentie yeares, to begin after the end of the former Leaſe, rendring the uſuall Rent, and died, the ſaid Counteſſe avoided this laſt Leaſe by Iudgement given in this Court, becauſe it ſhall be intended to be a Leaſe in Poſſeſſion, which he ought to make by the Proviſo, from the time of the making of it, otherwiſe by ſuch perverſe conſtruction, the true intent of the Statute ſhall be utterly defrauded.

                  <hi>Fennor,</hi> the Eſtate of the ſayd <hi>William</hi> is conditional by the Will, to wit, that he ſhall pay to <hi>Thomas</hi> the 40 Marks, according to the Will, becauſe the Will is, that the ſayd money ſhall be payd as is aforeſaid, or before the ſayd moneys which were to be payd, was expreſly limitted to be payd upon the forfeiture of his Eſtate: And further if it ſhall not be taken for a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then <hi>Thomas</hi> hath no remedy for the money to be payd to him; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be limitted to be payd but to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was dead before the day of payment of it, yet it ſhall be taken as a duty limited to him which ſhall be paid to his Executors, becauſe that a time certain is limited for the payment of it, to wit, when the Land is come to the ſayd <hi>William,</hi> which is, by the death of the ſayd <hi>Alice,</hi> but if no time had been limitted for the payment of it, and they had died before the payment of it, it had been otherwiſe; And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a condition in <hi>William,</hi> albeit it deſcend upon him, as well upon him as upon the Heir of the ſayd <hi>Thomas,</hi> yet it remains a good Condition for the part of the Heir of the ſayd <hi>Thomas,</hi> not determined by the deſcent of the other part upon the Heir of the ſayd <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further he ſayd, that here the Condition ſhall not be ſayd to be broken, but upon refuſall of payment by the ſayd <hi>William,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>George</hi> to whom it refers by the words (as is aforeſaid) which refuſall is not found, and therfore the Plaintiff ſhall be barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clench,</hi> The Executors of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> know not when, nor at what place to demand it, and therfore he thinks that the ſaid <hi>William</hi> ought to have tendred the money to the ſaid Executrix at his perill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham,</hi> The payment limited to be made by the ſaid <hi>George</hi> is at his firſt entry after the death of <hi>Alice,</hi> and then to pay 40 <hi>s.</hi> and ſo yearly untill 40 Marks are paid to the ſayd <hi>William,</hi> and therupon 40 <hi>s.</hi> yearly to the ſayd <hi>Thomas,</hi> untill other twenty Marks are paid to him; ſo that this is the form of the payment, to wit, at his entry, as well for the place as the time, for it cannot be made at his entry, unleſs upon the Land it ſelf, and therfore by the purport of the Wil, the Land ſhall be taken for the place where the payment ought to be made, for avoiding the inconvenience which otherwiſe will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; As if I am bound to pay to you 20 <hi>l.</hi> upon your firſt coming to ſuch a place, this place ſhall be taken for the place where the payment ſhall be made. And wheras it is ſaid further in the Will, and ſo to pay yearly 40 <hi>s.</hi> untill the twenty Marks are paid to <hi>William,</hi> this payment alſo by the words <hi>(and ſo to pay yearly,</hi> &amp;c.) ſhall be at the ſame place at the end of every year, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next day after the end of it, or otherwiſe there will be no certainty when it ſhall be paid, and therfore the firſt day of every year ſhall be the very day of payment, and this alſo by virtue of the ſaid words <hi>(and ſo yearly)</hi> And at the laſt day of payment by <hi>George</hi> to <hi>William,</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> there ought to be paid but 26 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> becauſe that then there remains no more to be paid of the ſumms limited to be paid to them; And when the Will here hath finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>George</hi> for that which he is to pay, it goes further, and if he refuſeth to pay the ſaid ſumms to <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> in manner and form aforeſaid, then he wils that all the ſaid Lands ſhall remain to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> and his Heirs for ever, paying yearly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo there is an expreſs penalty to <hi>George</hi> if he refuſe to make payment, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he ſhall looſe the Land for default of payment made by <hi>George</hi> by the word <hi>(paying)</hi> annexed to the Eſtate which is a Condition, but he conceived that this laſt payment to be made to <hi>Thomas,</hi> is not to be made upon any penalty, nor that a Condition is to be implyed in it, although <hi>Thomas</hi> hath no remedy for it, but in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe it is a meer confidence put in <hi>William</hi> to pay it: And he ſaid, that he was the rather moved to be of this opinion, becauſe every one of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53226:11"/>
precedent Limitations was with an expreſſe Condition annexed to them, as to <hi>George,</hi> if he refuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>William</hi> is to have but an Eſtate-tail upon the determination of the Eſtate made to <hi>George,</hi> for default of Iſſue there he ſaith nothing, but that the ſaid <hi>William</hi> ſhall pay to the ſaid <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> fortie Marks, as is aforeſaid, which is but a declaration of his intent, that he put confidence in him for the payment of it, and did not bind himſelf upon condition, as in the other caſes, which he might have done by expreſſe words of condition, if his intent had been ſo, as well as he did in the other caſes, if his purpoſe had been ſo; and the words, that he ſhall pay, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, is to be underſtood for the place and time when it ſhall be paid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>George</hi> ought to pay it: And it doth not ſeem to ſtand with reaſon, to expound it, for a Condition to deſtroy the Remainder limited to the ſaid <hi>Thomas;</hi> but if it ſhall be a Condition upon a relation, becauſe of the words, that he ſhall pay it, as aforeſaid mentioned, that the payment ought to be paid to the Executor of the ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> albeit he died before the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe this was a ſumm in groſſe limited to be paid to the ſaid <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> at a certain time. But if it ſhall be taken for a Condition in <hi>William,</hi> he thinks cleerly that the ſaid <hi>William</hi> ought to have given notice to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> before he had made his firſt entry into the Land of the Ten. when he intended to make his entry, ſo that the Executrix might be there at the ſame time to have made demand of the money, which ought to have been done, or otherwiſe there cannot be a refuſall in the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and without his refuſall or other default in him, the Condition cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if it had ſuch a relation as to make the payment as <hi>George</hi> ought to do it: And ſo the Executor of <hi>Thomas</hi> cannot have notice when <hi>William</hi> will make his firſt entry into the Land, if he do not give him notice of it, and therfore if it ſhall be a Condition it had been broken on the part of <hi>William,</hi> for want of giving notice to the Executor of the time of his firſt entry, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Executor might have notice of the time to make his demand, becauſe without a demand refuſall cannot be, and the Executor is excuſed to make demand when he had no notice of the time, and therfore the default of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> in not giving notice of it ſhall be taken againſt him as ſtrongly as if he had made a refuſall to pay upon demand; for if notice had been given to the Executor, and he had demanded the money, and <hi>William</hi> had ſaid nothing to it, but omitted to pay it, yet this ſhall be a refuſall in Law.</p>
               <p>But of this nothing appeareth in the Verdict, whether the Executor had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to him or not, nor nothing mentioned in the Verdict whether any demand or refuſall was made of the money or not, and therfore the Verdict as to theſe points is incertain to judge upon, whether it ſhall be taken to be a Condition in <hi>William:</hi> But it ſeems as the Verdict is, that Iudgment ought to be given againſt the Plaintiff, for the concluſion of the Verdict is upon the entry of the Defendant, whether this be lawfull or not, and not upon the expulſion, or whether upon the other Moyetie his entry was lawfull in right of the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> becauſe they were Tenants in Common.</p>
               <p>3. IN Treſpaſſe of Aſſault, Battery, and Impriſonment, made ſuch a day at in the Countie of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> brought by againſt: The Defendant ſaith, that he was Conſtable of the ſame Town, and that the Plaintiff the ſaid day, year, and place, brought an Infant not above the age of ten daies in his armes, and left him upon the ground to the great diſturuance of the people there being, and that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Plaintiff to take up the ſaid Infant, and to carry it from them with him, which the Plaintiff refuſed to do, for which cauſe he quietly laid his hands upon the Plaintiff and committed him to the Stocks in the ſame Town, where he continued for ſuch a time, untill he agreed to take up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant again, which is the ſame Aſſault, Battery, and Impriſonment, of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53226:11"/>
which the Plaintiff complains, upon which the Plaintiff demurred. <hi>Fennor</hi> was of opinion that that, which the Conſtable did was lawfull, and that it is hard that an Officer ſhall be ſo drawn in queſtion for it, for this ſhall be an utter diſcouragement to good Officers to execute their Offices as they ought to do. <hi>Popham,</hi> A Conſtable is one of the moſt ancient Officers in the Realm for the conſervation of the Peace, and by his Office he is a Conſervator of the Peace; and if he ſees any breaking of the Peace, he may take and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſen him untill he find ſurety by obligation to keep the Peace: And if a man in fury be purpoſed to kill, maime, or beat another; the Conſtable ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, may arreſt and impriſon him untill his rage be paſſed, for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Peace. And if a man layes an Infant which cannot help it ſelf upon a Dunghill, or openly in the field, ſo that the Beaſts or Fouls may deſtroy it, the Conſtable ſeeing it may commit the party ſo doing, to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for what greater breach of the Peace can there be then to put ſuch an Infant by ſuch means in danger of its life? And what diverſity is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this caſe and the caſe in queſtion, for no body was bound by the Law to take up the Infant but he which brought it thither, and by ſuch means the Infant might periſh, the default therof was in the Plaintiff, and therfore the Action will not lye: And therupon it was agreed that the Plaintiff take nothing by his Writ.</p>

And upon this Verdict Iudgment was given there, and an eſpeciall Writ of <hi>Habere facias ſeiſinam</hi> awarded of the ſaid Meſſuage, with the Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; <hi>viz.</hi> 18 foot of it from the North to the South, and 12 foot and an half of it from the Eaſt to the Weſt; upon which a Writ of Error being brought in the Kings Bench, it was alledged for Eror by <hi>Coke</hi> Sollicitor that upon this Verdict Iudgment ought to have been given for the Tenant, and not for the Demandant, for what was remaining of that which was of the houſe, is not a houſe, but only a peece of a houſe, and therfore it ought to have been demanded by the name of a peece of Land, containing ſo much one way, and ſo much another; for a houſe waſted and utterly drawn away, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demanded by a Meſſuage, but by the name of a Curtilage, or ſo much Land of ſuch contents; for a <hi>Praecipe</hi> lies of a peece of Land containing ſo many feet in length, and ſo many in breadth: And alſo Land built during the poſſeſſion of him which hath it by Tort, cannot be demanded by the name of Land by him which hath right, but by the name of a houſe, nor <hi>e contra,</hi> for every demand of Land ought to be made according to the nature of which it is at the time of the Action brought, be it a Meſſuage, Land, Meadow, Paſture, Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if the Walls of a houſe be made upon the Land without any covering, yet it ſhall be demanded but by the name of Land; for he ſaid, that it cannot be a houſe without its perfection to be habitable, which he ſaid is not here, becauſe it ſtands upon the Land of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> which hath not the perfection of a houſe habitable without the remnant. But this notwithſtanding the firſt Iudgment, was affirmed; for it was ſaid by <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and other Iuſtices, that, that which is erected upon the Land of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> ſhal be ſaid a houſe as to the right of the Heir of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> for a houſe may be ſuch to be demanded by the name of a houſe, albeit it hath not all the perfection of a houſe, as if it hath no doors, ſo if it hath part of the ſide wals not made, drawn away, or fallen, yet the remainder continues to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of an houſe; ſo if part of the covering be decayed, yet it ſhall be demanded by the name of an houſe, and the rather here, becauſe with that which is upon the other Land it is a perfect houſe; And I may have a perfect houſe although the ſide Walls belong to another: as in <hi>London,</hi> where a man joynes his houſe to the ſide walls of his Neighbours, he hath a perfect houſe, and yet the ſide walls belong to another, and this commonly happens in <hi>London,</hi> but it is otherwiſe if it were never covered, or if the covering be utterly fallen, or drawn away, for without a covering a houſe cannot be ſaid to be a houſe, for the covering to keep a man from the Storms and Tempeſts over head, is the principall thing belonging to a houſe.</p>
               <p>And further, ſuppoſe that a man hath a Kitchin, or a Hall upon Land, to which another hath right, he which hath right ought to demand it by the name of a houſe: ſuppoſe then that there is adjoyning to this upon other land a Parlor, a Buttery, a Shop, a Cloſet, and the like, with Chambers over them, this doth not change the form of the Writ that he is to have which hath right, although before it was built by the name of a houſe, and yet as to the rent both the one and the other was but a houſe, but as to the demandant it is otherwiſe, for they are ſeverall, ſo here: And the Demiſe which before was made of the houſe drawn away, ſhall be now upon the matter a Demiſe, as to this part of it a new Meſſuage; for if a man make a Leaſe for years of a houſe, and the Tetmor pull it down, and erect there a new houſe, or if land be demiſed, and the Leſſee build a houſe upon it, in an Action of Waſt, for Waſt done in this new houſe, the Writ ſhall ſuppoſe that he did waſt in the Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were demiſed to him, and yet in the one caſe it is not the Meſſuage which was demiſed to him, and in the other the houſe was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but the Land only; But he hath no term in the houſe but by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before made: And it ſeems to <hi>Popham,</hi> that <hi>Allen</hi> the Defendant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pull down this part of the houſe erect upon his own land to the prejudice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53226:12"/>
of the houſe which <hi>Hayes</hi> demands, if this which is erected upon the land of <hi>Allen</hi> be of ſuch a neceſſity, that without it the houſe of <hi>Hayes</hi> cannot ſtand for a houſe; but if he dies after that <hi>Hayes</hi> hath built it, then <hi>Hayes</hi> ſhall have an Action upon the caſe againſt him for the damages which he ſuſtained by it: As if a man agree with me that I ſhall ſet the outer wall of my houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his land, and I do it accordingly, and afterwards the party which grants me this licence, breaketh it down, if the Grant were by Deed I ſhall have an Action of Covenant for it, and if but by Paroll, yet I ſhall have an Action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the caſe againſt him. And here this being done by him which was then Owner and Poſſeſſor of the one and the other land, it ſhall be taken as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in Law, to the benefit of him which hath right, which he cannot pull down after it is once made, but he ſhall be ſubject to <hi>Hayes</hi> his Action for it, or otherwiſe <hi>Hayes</hi> ſhall be at great miſchief and prejudice by the Act of him which did the wrong, which the Law will not ſuffer, but rather ſhall turn this to the prejudice of him which did the wrong, then to the prejudice of the other which ſhall have wrong by the doing of it; for <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> As if I am to incloſe between my Neighbour and my ſelf, and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour pull down this incloſure or part of it, wherby my Cattell eſcape into the land adjoyning, and depaſture there, I ſhall be excuſed of this Treſpaſſe in the ſame manner as if he had licenced me to have occupied it, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hapneth to this Land adjoyning by my Neighbours means, ſhall be in the ſame degree as my Neighbours Act, for what he does ſhall be to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>And upon the Iudgment affirmed, the Attorney of the ſaid <hi>Hayes</hi> made the like Writ of <hi>Habere facias ſeiſinam,</hi> directed to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> as was done in the Common Pleas, wherupon it was affirmed to the Court in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term next enſuing, that the Sheriffs had made their execution by the quantity of the feet compriſed in the writ, and that in the doing of it there was pulled down the part of another houſe of the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> which was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two feet upon the land of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> and prayed remedy for it, and that this <hi>Habere facias ſeiſinam</hi> varying from the thing recovered, might not be filed; To which it was ſaid, that this quantity of feet was but a Surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Writ, and that the Writ before this was ſufficient and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Verdict and judgment.</p>

               <p>1.

               <p>And it was agreed by all the Juſtices that the ſaving in the Patent is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and Goal-delivery to ſit there for the things which happen within the County of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> for as the King may by his Letters Patents make a County, and exempt this from any other County, ſo may he in the making of it ſave and except to him and his Succeſſors ſuch part of the Iuriſdiction or priviledge which the other County from which it is exempted, had in it before; As in divers places of the Realm, the Goal of a Town which is a County of it ſelf, or which is a place priviledged from the County, is the Goal of the County, and the place where the Aſſiſes or Goal-delivery is holden, is within the County of the Town, and yet ſerve alſo for the County at large; as in the Seſſions Hall at <hi>Newgate,</hi> which ſerves as well for the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> as for <hi>London,</hi> and yet it ſtands in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but by uſage it hath alwaies been ſo, and nothing can be well preſcribed unto by uſage which cannot have a lawfull beginning by Award or Grant, and this by the diviſion of <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Middleſex</hi> at the beginning might be ſo. And ſo the Goal of <hi>Bury, &amp;c.</hi> And although that the words are, <hi>ſaving to him and his Heirs,</hi> yet by the word <hi>(Heirs)</hi> it ſhall be taken for a perpetual ſaving, which ſhall go to his Succeſſors, which is the Queen, and the rather becauſe it is a ſaving for Iuſtice to be done to the Subjects, which ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as largely as it can be: And albeit the expreſſe ſaving for the Sheriff is but for to hold his turn, yet in as much as the authority of the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and Goal-delivery in holding their Seſſions as before was accuſtomed is ſaved, it is Included in it, that all which appertain to the execution of this Service, is alſo ſaved, or otherwiſe the ſaving ſhall be to little purpoſe: And therfore that the Sheriff, or other Miniſter made by the authority of theſe Courts, is well made there and warranted by the Charter: And wee ought the rather to make ſuch expoſition of the Charter, becauſe it hath been alwaies after the Charter ſo put in execution by all the Iuſtices of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe: But it ſeems that by this Commiſion for the County a thing which happens in the Town cannot be determined, albeit it be Felony commited in the Hall during the Seſſions, but by a Commiſſion for the Towne it may.</p>

               <p>1. The firſt was, whether the effect of the Aſſurance made by Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was delivered into the Exchequer according to the intent of the Act, becauſe it wanted the time when it was made, and alſo one of the <hi>Proviſo's?</hi> And upon good deliberation they all did agree that it was not put in according to the purport of the ſaid Act, for the time may be materiall to be known, for the fraud which by the ſame Statute might be averred to be in the making of this Conveyance, and for the better tryall of the validity of the aſſurance and of the cauſe of it, therfore the true effect therof ought to de delivered or ſhewn in writing to be entred of Record, becauſe the Queens Councell may ſee and underſtand by it whether the Queen might have Title to it, or not; and how can this be if it doth not appear when it was done? And for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition how can the Queen by preſumption come to the notice of it, if it be not ſhewn to her? And this was one principall matter of the effect of the ſaid aſſurance which ought to have been ſhewn, for this ſhewing ought to be for the benefit and advantage of the Queen, and not ſo much for the advantage of the party. And here the effect of it which ſhall ſhew for the Queen is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and therfore not ſhewn in writing according to the purport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Statute, which was, that by it the Queen and her Councell may ſee what will make for her in the Grant, Conveyance, or Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>2. Whether this Condition were given to the Queen, becauſe that the words in this Indenture precedent to the Condition, are theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe that the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> the Nephew might happen to be of evill behaviour and government; the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> provided as before, which (as was alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) was founded upon a particular regard and reſpect, which was proper to himſelf, and therfore cannot be transferred to the Queen; and it doth not appear that he yet had been of ill behaviour: But this notwithſtanding, all agreed that this Condition is in the Queen by the attainder of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> as well by the Act of his Attainder, as by the Act of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which give the forfeiture of Conditions alſo expreſſy in the caſe of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>3. Whether there ought to be an Office for finding the performance of the Condition according to the Warrant, and all agreed that there need not, becauſe that when any man is to do a thing by Warrant of Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for the Queen, to be returned in any Court, it ſufficeth for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, which he haſh done according to the Letters Patents, with the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it ſelf, and then that which is ſo returned, is as well of Record as if it were found by Office and returned of Record; and ſo it was agreed in the Exchequer, about 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Edward Dacres,</hi> who had made an Aſſignment of his Goods and Chattells to Sir <hi>Alexander Culpdpper</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who afterwards was attainted of Treaſon by Outlawry, and the Condition adjudged to be forfeited to the Queen by the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and a Warrant was made by Letters Patents to Sir <hi>Thomas George</hi> to perform the Condition, who did it, and returned that he had done it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, wherby the aſſurance to the ſaid Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Companions was avoided, and all the Goods and Chattels of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> forfeited to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53226:15"/>
the Queen, and all this was in the Queen without Office found, for that which the Sheriff or other Miniſter doth by virtue of any Writ or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which is to be of Record, when it is returned of Record, it is as well of Record as the Writ or Warrant it ſelf, ſo here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But the greateſt queſtion was (which was not any thing in the caſe here) whether the Eſtate made to <hi>Francis</hi> the Nephew were void, <hi>eo inſtanti</hi> upon <hi>Hillary</hi> Term finiſhed 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> although the two year after the Seſſion of Parliament, 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> did not end untill the 28. day of <hi>March,</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in as much as no Term was or could be within two years after it, in which the aſſurance or the effect of it might be ſhewn openly in the Court of Exchequer, or that it ſhall tarry to be void untill the two years are fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; as if a man make aſſurance of his Land upon condition, that if he do not go to <hi>Rome</hi> within two years next enſuing, that it ſhall be to the uſe of <hi>I. S.</hi> and his Heirs, and he ſtay untill a week within the end of the two years, in ſo much as it is not poſſible to perform it within the two years, yet the uſe doth not change untill the two years are paſt; but in this caſe it ought to be ſhewn a Term within the two years, which is as much as to ſay, that if the Terms be all paſt, ſo as it cannot be done after it within the two years, the Aſſurance <hi>eo inſtanti</hi> upon the finiſhing of the laſt Term is become void; as if an Aſſurance be upon condition, that if in the Term time, within two years he do not levy a Fine to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now if the laſt Term paſſe without the Fine, the Vſe change, albeit the two years be not expired; <hi>ſi Parolls fort Plea:</hi> And there is great diverſity where an Eſtate is to be defeated, or an Vſe is to be raiſed upon an Act to be done, or not done, within a time certain, within two years, and where within two years ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, for in the firſt caſe the Vſe change upon the Act done, or not done immediatly, and in the other not untill the two years are finiſhed, becauſe that by preſumption alwaies within two years the Act may be done for any thing of which the Law takes <hi>conuſance.</hi> But if the Act to be done, or not done, refer to any time certain within the two years, as if he do not pay 10<hi>l.</hi> to one before the Feaſt of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel within the two years, that then the Vſe ſhall change, or the Eſtate ſhall be void, in theſe caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly upon the laſt Feaſt of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel, within the two years the Vſe change, or the Eſtate ſhall be void, as the caſe is, and ſhall not tarry untill the full end of the two years to do it, for in the words themſelves the diverſity appeareth.</p>

               <p>And the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> for him and his Heirs, did further covenant with the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> that if it ſhould happen that the ſaid Sir

               <p>And upon this, it was moved, that there was a variance between this Deed now ſhewn, and this Inrolement, and that therfore it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, whether this Deed was ſhewn in the Court or delivered there accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Statute therof made, 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for in the Deed it is (for other good cauſes) and this word <hi>(good)</hi> is not compriſed within the Inrolement.</p>
               <p>But as to it, all the Iudges and Barons agreed, that albeit theſe defeats hapned by the negligence of the Clerk in writing and examining, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollement remaines good, in as much as the omiſſions are in matters and words which are of abundance, and not in that which is any ſubſtance of the Deed.</p>
               <p>But the Lords of Parliament which were Committees of this caſe in the Parliament, ſent for the Record of the ſayd Inrolement, and would have had this to have been amended in the Chamber next to the Parliament; but as the Officer was in doing of it, the Iudges adviſed that it ſhould not be done, as well becauſe this was not the place where it ought to be amended, but the Court of Exchequer if it were, or needed to be amended: And alſo becauſe that the two years after the Seſſion of Parliament of 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was then paſt.</p>
               <p>Then it was moved whether by the Covenant and conſiderations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the uſe ſhall paſſe or were raiſed to <hi>John Englefield,</hi> or now to his Son <hi>Francis,</hi> Nephew to the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and begotten upon the body of the ſayd <hi>Margaret.</hi> And all agreed that it is not for divers reaſons.</p>

               <p>And yet further, that it ſhall deſcend, come, or remain to <hi>John</hi> in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or reverſion, ſo that he may make the one or the other void at his pleaſure, which cannot be, if an Vſe ſhall be raiſed by it, and therfore alſo it enures but as a bare Covenant, which he may perform either the one or the other way at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is, that it ſhall ſo deſcend or come to <hi>John</hi> without any act or thing done or to be done by him to the contrary, wherby alſo it fully appeareth, that the aſſurance of the ſaid <hi>John</hi> ſhall ſtand for all this Land upon the Covenant, and not upon any uſe which was to be altered or changed by it.</p>

But if an Vſe may change by the Mannor upon the conſideration, yet it ſhall not change to the ſaid <hi>John</hi> or his Iſſues, untill the death of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> without Iſſue Male, becauſe that untill that happen, if the ſaid <hi>John</hi> had been living, he had not had any Vſe, becauſe it is that he ſhall have the Land then if he be then living, and if it ſhall not be in him untill this time, it ſhall not be in his Son untill Sir <hi>Francis</hi> be dead without Iſſue; for it is if the ſaid <hi>John</hi> or any Iſſue Male of his body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be then living, then it ſhall deſcend, come, or remain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that it doth not come to them untill it may appear whether the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> or any Iſſue Male of his body upon the body of the ſaid <hi>Margaret,</hi> be in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> when Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſhall be dead without Iſſue Male, and therfore it yet remains upon a contingent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the uſe ſhall be to the Heirs Males of the body of the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> if it ſhall be ſaid that it is an Vſe, and therfore in the mean time the entire Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple remains in Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> not yet changed, but for the Eſtate tail it ſelf in himſelf, if any change ſhall be, as appeareth before that it ſhall not be, and therfore by the attainder of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> the whole Fee-ſimple is now all forfeited to the Queen, before that the uſe may be to the Heirs Males of the body of the ſaid <hi>John:</hi> And the Queen ſhall not come to this Land in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny privity by the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> but in the <hi>Poſt</hi> by the Eſcheat, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poſſeſſion of the Queen now, or of her Patentee ſhall never be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with this Vſe, which ſhall never be carried out of any other poſſeſſion but ſuch which remaineth in privity untill the uſe is to come in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> no more now then as it might at common Law before the Statute of Vſes, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is a penſion, wheras a Penſion is not ſutable in our Law, but in the Spirituall Court; To which <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſaid, that there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity between a common Recovery, which is an aſſurance between parties and a Recovery which is upon Title, for a common Recovery is to an Vſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> to the uſe of him againſt whom it is had, if no other uſe can be aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and therfore as to the Vſe, it is to be guided according to the intent of the parties, and by a common Recovery had againſt Tenant for life, he in the Reverſion if he be not party or privy to it, may enter for a forfeiture, as it was adjudged very lately in the Exchequer, by the advice of all the Iuſtices in the caſe of a Recovery had againſt Sir <hi>William Petham</hi> Knight, and in all theſe things it is otherwiſe in caſe of a Recovery upon Title, and therfore in as much as this common Recovery is but a common Aſſurance between parties, and is alwaies by aſſent between parties, to the end that they may make aſſurance from one to another, there ſhall be and alwaies hath been a contrary expoſition to a Recovery which is by pretence of Title, and it hath been common to put in ſuch Recoveries, Advowſons, Commons, Warrens, and the like, and yet alwaies allowed: And if this ſhall be now drawn in queſtion, infinite Aſſurances ſhall by this be indangered, which the Law will not ſuffer, and therfore the demand of an Advowſon and Penſion in the Writ of Entry makes not the Writ vitious, as it ſhall do in another Writ of Entry founded upon a Title and not upon an Aſſurance. And as to that, that the Rent and the Advowſon alſo is demanded, this is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Advowſon is another thing then the Rectory it ſelf, out of which the Rent is demanded to be iſſuing: And for the diſjunctive demand of the Rent or Penſion, it makes no matter in this caſe, becauſe it is a common Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in which ſuch a preciſe form is not neceſſary to be uſed as in other Writs, and alſo a Penſion iſſuing out of a Rectory is the ſame with the rent: To which <hi>Clench and Fennor</hi> agreed in all; but <hi>Popham</hi> moved that the greateſt difficulty in this caſe is the demand made to the diſjunctive, <hi>to wit,</hi> of the annuall Rent or Penſion, for if a Penſion iſſuing out of a Rectory ſhall be ſaid to be a thing meerly ſpirituall, and not to be demanded by our Law, or meerly of another nature then the Rent it ſelf, with which it is conjoyned by the word <hi>(or)</hi> then it is erroneous; for albeit a common Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, be now a common aſſurance of Land paſt by the aſſent of parties, and therfore hath another conſervation, then that which paſſeth by pretence of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet we are not to omit groſſe abſurdities in ſuch common Recoveries, as to demand an acre of Land or Wood in the Mannor of <hi>Sale,</hi> or <hi>Dale,</hi> or <hi>black acre,</hi> or <hi>white acre,</hi> theſe are not good in common Recoveries, becauſe there is no certainty in the demand which of them the party is to recover, which kind of abſurdity is not to be admitted in theſe Recoveries; for this is but a meer ignorance in the Law and the Miniſters of it. And to this <hi>Gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the other Juſtices</hi> agreed, but they ſayd, that a Penſion iſſuing and a Rent ſhall be taken for all one; for if a man grant a Penſion of 20 <hi>s.</hi> a year, iſſuing out of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> or of the Rectory of <hi>S</hi> theſe are Rents iſſuing out of them: and if the demand had been of an annuall Rent, or Annuity of 20 <hi>s.</hi> a year iſſuing out of the Rectory, this had been good. To which <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> agreed, and yet ſayd, if it had been an annuall Rent of 20 <hi>s. &amp;c.</hi> or of an Annuity of 20 <hi>s.</hi> it had nof been good, becauſe that the word <hi>(iſſuing)</hi> is not referred to the Annuity, but to the Rent only, and therfore are meerly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and not as the ſame, but if the demand were of an annuity, rent, or payment of 20 <hi>s.</hi> iſſuing out of a Rectory, it is good, for this is but one and the ſame. Then it was alledged that notwithſtanding that which appears to the Court, it cannot be taken that this was a common Recovery, for upon the aſſignment of the Error, it is not averred that it was a common Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,

to which <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, that common Recoveries are ſuch common Aſſurances to all perſons that are well known to all, and eſpecially to us that they need not be averred, for they are known by certain Marks, <hi>to wit,</hi> by the voluntary entry into the Warranty, the common Voucher and the like: And at laſt they all agreed that the Iudgment ſhall be affirmed.</p>

And there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity where two matters are limited in Deed, and where one is limited in a Deed, and the other by the Law: And the contrary objections are eaſily anſwered, for when the Tenant in tail of the King dies without Iſſue, it is in the King without Office, becauſe the Law does not help them which contemn it. But in caſe of an Office which is forfeited, it is in the King to diſpoſe without Office, becauſe the King is not to have the Office it ſelf but the diſpoſition of it, and yet it is to be defeated by <hi>Scire facias</hi> in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
               <p>If a Mill be demiſed for life, upon condition that he ſhall not let it but to a Milner, and he breaks the Condition, in caſe of the King there muſt be an Office to avoid it, and there the Office entitles the King to the Condition and not to the Entry, for after the Office it is not in the King untill Entry: And here the Rent may be paid to the Kings Bayly in the Country, which is matter <hi>in fait,</hi> and therfore ſhall not be defeated without Office; And here the Office comes too late to give any advantage to the Patentee, for the King cannot grant a Title of Entry before Office, no more then the Aſſignes of a common perſon can take advantage of a Condition broken in the time of the Grantor, of which the Grantor did not take advantage in his time; And if the Queen makes a Leaſe <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> the Patentee ſhall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, as it appears in the Lord <hi>Burgleighs</hi> caſe, and therfore the Office her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Clench</hi> agreed cleerly, that it was a Limitation, but yet that it is at the Queens liberty to avoid or make it good, for perhaps the Rent is better then the value of the Land, and upon this reaſon a Leaſe from the King <hi>Probi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Popham,</hi> to ſay that the Office helps the Queen for the mean Profits, and that now the Patentee ſhall not take advantage to avoid the Leaſe is too abſurd; for the Queen cannot take advantage to have the mean Profits, but in reſpect of the avoidance of the Leaſe: And if the Leaſe were made void or determined againſt the Queen, it ſhall not remain good and of force againſt the Patentee, and alſo to ſay, that the Leaſe might have its continuance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it is determined by the Limitation comprehended in the Writing, by reaſon of a reſervation, is alſo too abſurd, for ſo it may be ſaid, that if the Queen make a Leaſe for years, if <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall live ſo long, rendring rent, that this Leaſe may have continuance after the death of <hi>J. S.</hi> which cleerly is not Law; And the Patentee here ſhall take the advantage to avoid the Leaſe hapned before his Patent made, becauſe that no Office need to be found of the not payment before it paſſed from the Queen to make it voyd, and the reaſon is, becauſe this <hi>Proviſo</hi> (as it is penned) is a meer Limitation of the Eſtate, and not any manner of Condition; And therfore if the Queen
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53226:18"/>
make a Leaſe for 100. years, if the Leſſee ſhall ſo long lawfully pay the Rent reſerved at the day of payment, if he fail of payment of the Rent reſerved at the day limited, the Leaſe is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> determined, and it need not be found by Office. And what diverſity is there where the Limitation is conjoyned to the eſtate it ſelf, and where it cometh in by a <hi>Proviſo</hi> afterwards, all being in one and the ſame Deed, and therfore ſpoken at one and the ſame time, for the one and the other caſe manifeſteth that the contract and agreement is, that the Leaſe ſhall not continue longer then the default of the payment of the Rent.</p>
               <p>And in this caſe, ſuppoſe that the Queen had granted over the Land? ſhall not the Patentee have advantage to avoid the Leaſe, becauſe that no Office was found before? It is cleer that he ſhall, or otherwiſe this is now become to be an abſolute Leaſe for a hundred years, which is not Law, for it is meerly contrary to the Contract, and therfore abſurd to be maintained: I agree with the generall rule that nothing ſhal paſſe to, or from the Queen but by matter of Record; but this makes nothing againſt me in this caſe, for here the ſame Record which paſſeth the Eſtate to the party, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Patent of the Leaſe contains the time how long it ſhall endure, longer then which it cannot continue: And therfore by 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. If the King makes a Gift in tail, and the Donce dies without Iſſue, the Land is in the King without Office, ſo in every other caſe where the Eſtate is determined according to the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he cannot be put out of poſſeſſion wrongfully, and now hath right to hold it againſt him. And I ſay that no warrant or authority can be found throughout the whole Law where a Leaſe or Eſtate made by the King is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by an expreſſe limitation compriſed in the Patent it ſelf of the Grant, that there need not any Office or other thing to determine it, for that which is compriſed in the ſame Patent may determine it, of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And further, wheras the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is, that the re-entry ſhall be for default of payment of the Rent, and the like, there the Term continues untill the re-entry be made, notwithſtanding the Condition be broken, as appeareth by all the Iuſtices, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. becauſe it is expreſly limited that it ſhall be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the re-entry, &amp; there before re-entry be made, the Action of Waſt ſhall be, <hi>quod tenet:</hi> And by 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. where a common perſon is put to his Entry, there the Queen is put to an Office, with which agrees <hi>Stamford</hi> in his Book of <hi>Prerogative:</hi> But in this caſe, if it were between common perſons, the Leaſe ſhall be determined upon default of payment of the Rent, and before any re-entry, and therfore in the Queens caſe it ſhall be determined without Office. But if the caſe had been, that if the Rent had been arrear and not paid, that then upon re-entry made, it ought to ceaſe, there an Office had been neceſſary to countervail the Entry in caſe of the Queen, or otherwiſe the Leaſe ſhall not ceaſe, becauſe the Queen cannot make an Entry but by ſuch means, and therfore it ought to be by matter compriſed in the Patent. It hath been ſaid, that this ſhall be a conditionall Limitation, and that therfore an Office is neceſſary; but I ſay, that here is not any matter or quality of a Condition, but meerly of a Limitation, and tis rather a contingent Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any manner of Condition, and this is well proued by 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which is, that the Grantee of a Reverſion ſhal take advantage of it at common Law, the which he cannot do if it ſavour any way of a Condition, and by 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>a Proviſo</hi> in a Deed ought alwaies to be expounded according to the purport, becauſe that it is placed in a Deed, ſomtimes for a Condition, as where a <hi>Proviſo</hi> is that the Leſſee ſhall not alien; ſomtimes for an exception, as where a <hi>Proviſo</hi> is, that the Leaſe ſhall not extend to ſuch an acre, or ſuch a thing, ſomtimes for a Limitation, as here and in the like caſes. And in this caſe the releaſe of the Rent ſhall make it, that the Leaſe ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the not payment of it, becauſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

abſolute and diſcharged of the contingent, which otherwiſe had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it: As if a man make a Leaſe for a 100. years, if the Leſſee in the mean time do not cut ſuch a Tree, a releaſe of all Conditions will not ſerve, yet if the Leſſor himſelf or any other but the Leſſee cut it, the Leaſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolute for a 100. years: And ſo upon this point my conceit appeareth. But the moſt colourable thing which hath been alledged on the other ſide, was by my Brother <hi>Drew,</hi> which was, that in counting upon an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> and pleading in ſuch a Leaſe as here, it ſhall be as an abſolute Leaſe for the years compriſed in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> without making any mention of the <hi>Prouiſo,</hi> upon which he enforced it that it ſhall be taken to be of more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy then if it ſtood meerly upon the Contingent; for he ſaid, that upon a Leaſe made for years, if the Leſſee ſhall ſo long live, and the like, in the count, and alſo in the pleading mention ought to be made of the life of the Leſſee: I agree it to be true that the pleading ſhall be ſo, for in count coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in plea pleading, if the matter of the Contingent procede the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, or be anncred to the Limitation, there a man ought to ſpeak to the Contingent, or otherwiſe it is not good, as by 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it ſhall be of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition where it is precedent; But in caſe of a Condition it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> man make a Leaſe to another for years, <hi>Si tamdiu vixerit,</hi> or <hi>Dummodo ſolverit, &amp;c.</hi> or the like, which are annexed to the limitation of the Eſtate; in all theſe caſes in counting and alſo in pleading, he ought to aver the life of the Leſſee, or otherwiſe the contents of the thing according to the limitation: But where that which was the Limitation cometh by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> after the <hi>Habendum</hi> which diſtinguiſheth the ſentence as here, there, becauſe it it is a matter diſtinct and ſubſequent from the <hi>Habendum,</hi> and not annered to it, he need not to ſpeak of it, but there it ſhall alwaies come in to be ſhewn of the other part, and this is the uſuall and common caſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for pleading, but this makes no difference of the Eſtate; And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if an Obligation be made with a Condition endorſed, the Plaintiff in debt upon it doth not ſpeak of the Condition in his Count, but if the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be precedent, or ſtands compriſed within the body of the Obligation, then he ought to ſpeak of it in his Count, as appeareth by 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. where a man was bound in twenty quarters of Malt, to be paid at ſuch a day, and if he fail, that he ſhall pay forty quarters at ſuch a day, if he demand the forty quarters in his count, he ought to ſhew the default of payment of the twenty quarters at the day limited for it, and yet the Condition that is out of, and that which is comprehended within the Obligation are but as one for the ſubſtance, but for the form it differs as to the pleading, which form ought to be obſerved.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53226:19"/>
no Office to be found of it, the matter it ſelf being apparant upon Record, and therfore as it appeareth it was adjudged in 13 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that a new Patent of the ſame Office of Remembrancer making recitall of the former Patent (which appeared as before upon Record to be void) with a clauſe <hi>Quod poſt mortem ſive determinationem, &amp;c.</hi> therof, the new Grant ſhall take effect, was void. And <hi>Englefields</hi> caſe was lately adjudged in the Exchequer (and at the Parliament 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> allowed to be good Law by all the Iuſtices there being) where the Queen had a Condition given to her by forfeiture upon an Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Treaſon to be performed by the payment of a ſumm of money, or the like: If the Queen makes a Warrant by Patent to one to perform the Condition, and to return his proceedings therupon into the Exchequer, who performs it accordingly, and therupon returns all that he hath done with his Warrant into the Exchequer, no Office need to be found of the performance of the Condition, becauſe that by the return (which is warranted by the Patent) the Condition appeareth ſufficiently upon Record to be performed, and therfore no Office need to be found, no more of the not-payment in this caſe. It hath been ſaid by ſome, that it may be that the Patentee hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Rent at the receit, and that they would not receive or record the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it, and that then it ſhould be hard that he ſhould looſe his Leaſe, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault being in him: to which I ſay, ſuppoſe a man be bound to make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in any of the Kings Courts, may he ſay, that he appeared there accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Obligation, &amp; excuſe himſelf by ſuch bare averment therof, unleſſe his appearance be entred of Record? It is cleer that he cannot, as appeareth by 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. for appearance in a Court of Record, is not unleſſe it be of Record, yet it may be ſaid, that then the caſe may be had to the party: as if the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer will not record his appearance, which is the ſame miſchief as in this caſe, but this will not help him, for firſt the Law preſumes that every Officer wil be indifferent betwixt party and party; and upon this opinion had of him he is admitted to his Office, wherupon the Law preſumes that if the party would have appeared, that the Officer would have recorded it, and in as much as he did not do it, it ſhall be taken that he did not appear. But the ſtrongeſt reaſon in the caſe is this, <hi>to wit,</hi> if default be not in the party to do that which he ought to do, but in the Officer to do that which belongeth to his Office, as to record that which he ought to record, there the Officer ſhall be chargable to the party in an Action upon the caſe, to anſwer him ſo much in Damages as he hath ſuſtained by ſuch default of the Officer, and the Law will put the party rather to ſuch a recovery then to anſwer it by a bare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of averment which ought to be of Record. And further ſuch a voluntary default may be a forfeiture of his Office, and ſo a ſufficient penalty in caſe of an Officer. And to ſay, that the Office of Receit is not an Office of Record, is too abſurd, for it is a principall member and part of the Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and as wel of Record, for the matters belonging to it, as the Offices of the Pipe and Remembrancers are for thoſe things which belong to them; and the Records of Receit as well inrolled in Rolls of Parchment as any other Records of the Queen in this, or any other Court, &amp; it is commonly uſed now to convey Reverſions &amp; Remainders to the Queen, with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> to be void upon payment of a certain ſum of mony to the Queen at the receit of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, &amp; it is as uſual upon payment made there to have it back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out office found of this paym. and what is the reaſon of it? now, but becauſe the paym. there is alwaies entred upon Record, &amp; therfore no Office needs make this paym. to appear upon Record. And for the caſe of Sir <hi>Rob. Cheſter.</hi> 4 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there is great diverſity between that &amp; this caſe, for it is ordained by the Act that upon the default of paym. (which is not limited there to be made at the receit) the office ſhal be forfeited, &amp; not that the eſtate in the office ſhall ceaſe: And of a thing forfeited it is at the election of him who is to take advantage of the forfeiture, whether he will take it or not, and till the advantage taken therof the party ſtill remains an Officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53226:20"/>
And therfore if the Queen make a Leaſe for years, and the Termer makes a Feoffment in Fee, the Term by this is extinct, as was agreed upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the Exchequer 28 <hi>El.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Drayton Baſſet,</hi> and before that, in the ſame caſe in the Kings Bench, and yet no reverſion is drawn therby out of the Queen. Suppoſe then that the Queen before any Office found therof, grant the Land over in Fee, ſhall not the Patentee take advantage therof by extinguiſhing the Term? It is cleer that he ſhall, and albeit a Termer holdeth over his Term, yet the Patentee of the Queen, and alſo the Bargainee of a common perſon after the Inrolement of the Bargain ſhall take advantage of this determination of the Term.</p>
               <p>And for the not reciting of <hi>Throgmortons</hi> Leaſe in the Letters Patents made to <hi>Finch</hi> and <hi>Audeley,</hi> it is to no purpoſe to ſpeak to it, becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was finiſhed before the Grant; And further, becauſe there was a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> in the Patent, that it ſhall be effectuall, notwithſtanding any not recitall of any Leaſe being of Record, or not being of Record, miſ-recitall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was by all at the Bonch admitted to be good, and not contradicted by any.</p>
               <p>And for the Office found after the Grant made, I did not ſpeak to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of no purpoſe to help the Patentee, but yet ſhall ſerve the Queen for the mean profits, as hath been ſaid: <hi>See more of this caſe, Trin.</hi> 36 <hi>Eliz. pl.</hi> 2.</p>

And therfore in an Action upon the caſe upon an <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> it ſufficeth to ſay, that wheras the Defendant was indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Plaintiff in divers ſumms of money amounting in all to a 100 <hi>l.</hi> the Defendant aſſumed to pay him the 100 <hi>l.</hi> at ſuch a day, without ſaying, how or in what manner theſe Debts accrued, or when, becauſe the Action is nor meerly founded upon the Debt but upon the promiſe, and the Debts are but inducements to it: But if it were to recover the Debts themſelves in an Action of Debt there ought to be made a certainty therof, <hi>to wit,</hi> when, and how it comes.</p>
               <p>And further here, in as much as the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> is found for the Plaintiff, it ſhall be implyed that the conſideration was duly performed, for without due proof of the conſideration the Plaintiff hath failed of his aſſumption, and therfore alſo it ſhall be now taken that the Teſtator hath ſuch a term of years in reverſion, to which the term for years in poſſeſſion may be ſurrendred, for he ſaid, that he who hath ten years in poſſeſſion may well ſurrender to him who hath more years, as twenty in reverſion; for the leſſer may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to the greater term.

And after the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> takes to Husband one <hi>John Adye,</hi> who with his ſaid wife ſurrendred his ſaid part to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>John Adye</hi> and of his ſaid wife, and of their Heirs; and afterwards the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> died without Iſſue, and the ſaid <hi>John Adye</hi> held the part of his ſaid wife, and ſurrendred it to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Richard Brook,</hi> and of one <hi>John North,</hi> and their Heirs who were admitted accordingly, after which, the ſaid <hi>John Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor</hi> died without Iſſue, and now the ſaid <hi>Henry Gravenor</hi> was ſole Heirs to him, and alſo to the ſaid <hi>Henry Hall</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>Edward Gravenor,</hi> and dyed, the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> entred into the ſaid Lands called <hi>Preachers,</hi> and did let it to the Plaintiff, upon whom the ſaid <hi>Richard Brook</hi> and the other Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants did re-enter and eject him.

               <p>And by <hi>Clench</hi> and <hi>Gawdy,</hi> an Eſtate tail cannot be of Copyhold Land, unleſſe it be in caſe where it hath been uſed, for the Statute of <hi>Donis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionalibus</hi> ſhall not enure to ſuch cuſtomary Lands, but to Lands which are at common Law, and therfore an Eſtate tail cannot be of theſe cuſtomary Lands, but in caſe where it hath been uſed time out of mind, and they ſaid, that ſo it hath been lately taken in the Common Bench; But they ſaid, that the firſt remainder limited to the ſaid <hi>John Gravenor</hi> here upon the death of the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> was a good Fee-ſimple conditional, which is well warrantes by the cuſtom to demiſe in Fee, for that which by cuſtom may be demiſed of an Eſtate in Fee abſolute, may alſo be demiſed of a Fee-ſimple conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or upon any other limitation, as if <hi>I. S.</hi> hath ſo long Iſſue of his body, and the like, but in ſuch a caſe no Remainder can be limited over, for one Fee cannot remain over upon another, and therfore the Remainder to the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> was void: But they ſaid, that for all the life of the ſaid <hi>John Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor,</hi> nothing was in the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> which could deſcend from her to the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> her Daughter, or that might be ſurrendred by the ſaid <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> and her Husband, and therfore the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> dying without Iſſue, in the life time of the ſaid <hi>John Gravenor</hi> who had the Fee-ſimple conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, nothing was done which might hinder the ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi> Son to the ſaid <hi>Henry Gravenor</hi> of his Entry, and therfore the ſaid Plaintiff ought to have his Iudgment to recover, for they took no regard to that which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage did, <hi>4th.</hi> year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fennor</hi> and <hi>Popham</hi> held, that an Eſtate tail is wrought out of Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Land by the equity of the Statute of <hi>Donis conditionalibus,</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot be that there can be any Eſtate tail of Copyhold Land, for by uſage it cannot be maintained, becauſe that no Eſtate tail was known in Law before this Statute, but all were Fee-ſimple, and after this Statute it cannot be by uſage, becauſe this is within the time of limitation, after which an uſage cannot make a preſcription, as appeareth 22 <hi>&amp;</hi> 23 <hi>Eliz. in Dyer:</hi> And by 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Cuſtom cannot be made after <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. And what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are of Copyhold land, appeareth expreſly by <hi>Littleton,</hi> in his Chapter of <hi>Tenant by Copyhold, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Brook</hi> Title, <hi>Tenant by Copyhold, &amp;c.</hi> 15 <hi>H.</hi> 8. In both which it appeareth that a Plaint lyeth in Copyhold Land in the nature of a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Deſcender at common Law, and this could not be before the Statute of <hi>Donis conditionalibus</hi> for ſuch Land, becauſe that before that Statute there was not any <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Deſcender</hi> at common Law, and therfore the Statute helps them for their remedy for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed Land which is cuſtomary by equity: Add if the Action ſhall be given by equity for this Land, why ſhall not the Statute by the ſame equity work to make an Eſtate intail alſo of this nature of the Land? We ſee no reaſon to the contrary; and if a man will well mark the words of the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. 1.</hi> he ſhall well perceive that the <hi>Formedon in Deſcender</hi> was not before this Statute, which wills that in a new caſe a new remedy may be given, and therupon ſets the form of a <hi>Formedon</hi> in <hi>Deſcender:</hi> But as to

the <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Reverter,</hi> it is then ſaid, that it is uſed enough in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and by <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in his <hi>Natura brevium,</hi> the <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cender</hi> is founded upon this Statute, and was not at Common Law before; And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe Copyholds are now become by uſage to be ſuch Eſtates that the Law allows them to be good againſt the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they performing their Cuſtoms and Services, and therfore are more commonly guided by the guides and rules of the common Law, and therfore as appeareth in <hi>Dyer, Tr.</hi> 12. <hi>Eliz.

And for the dying ſeiſed of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they did not regard it, for ſhe cannot dye ſeiſed of it as a Copyholder, for ſhe had no right to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholder of it: And by the dying ſeiſed of a Copyholder at common Law, it ſhall be no prejudice to him who hath right, for he may enter; But here in as much as ſhe cometh in by admittance of the Lord at the Court, her Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation cannot be fortious to him, and therfore no deſcent at common Law by her dying ſeiſed, for it was but as an Occupation at Will. But if it ſhall not be an Eſtate tail in <hi>John Gravenor,</hi> as they conceive ſtrongly it is, yet for the other cauſes alledged by <hi>Gawdy</hi> and <hi>Clench,</hi> Iudgment ought to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Plaintiff, and the Remainder which is not good ſhall not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Fee-ſimple conditionall granted to <hi>John,</hi> which is no more then if the Surrender had been to the uſe of <hi>Iohn Gravenor</hi> and his Heirs, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder over, becauſe that we as Iudges ſee that this cannot be good by Law, and therfore not to be compared to the caſe where the Cuſtom war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants but one life, and the Lord grants two joyntly or ſucceſſively, there both the one and the other is void: And this is true, becauſe the cuſtom is the cauſe that it was void, and not the Law, and alſo it is a larger Eſtate then the Cuſtom warrants, which is not here, and upon this Iudgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that the Plaintiff ſhall recover.</p>

To which the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and was found guilty at the Aſſiſes at <hi>Ayleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to the Damages of 200. marks: And now it was alledged in Arreſt of Iudgment, that this matter appeareth to be meerly ſpirituall, and therfore not determinable at common Law, but to be proſecuted in the ſpirituall Court. But <hi>per Curiam</hi> the Action lies here, for a woman not maried can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot by intendment have ſo great advancement as by her Marriage, wherby ſhe is ſure of maintenance for her life, or during her Marriage, and Dower and other benefits which the temporall Laws gives by reaſon of her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

               <p>Vpon which it was demurred generally, and by all the Court the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff had Iudgment to recover; for we are to conſider what our Law was in this caſe before this Statute of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And albeit a Doctor then affirmed, that the Canon Law was, that there was a meer nullity in ſuch Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo although the party that did it, not being a Clark nor Doctor, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Stat. of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. yet all the Iuſtices agreed, that the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo committed will be adjudged in our Law to be of force and effect, being ſhewn under the Seal of the Officer and committed by him, who is reputed the Officer, who ought to do it, and is inveſted in the Office untill it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by ſentence, and yet ſuch an avoidance ſhall not make a mans act to be made void, no more then if a meer Lay-man be preſented to a benefice, albeit this be a meer nullity in our Law, and void, yet we adjudge the Church full, according to the publike admiſſion, conſtitution and induction, and not according to the capacity of the perſon, which is a thing ſecret, untill ſuch a one be deprived for it by ſentence in the ſpirituall Court, and yet the Church ſhall be in our Law void but from the time of deprivation, of which notice ought to be given to the Patron.</p>

So here, he remains as to our Law an Officer untill his authority be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſentence of the ſpirituall Court, otherwiſe great miſchief will happen; for an infinite number of Adminiſtrations may be drawn in queſtion by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, that he, who granted them was a meer lay perſon, and ſo make ſuch Garboils in the Common-wealth, which is not to be ſuffered for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency which will happen by it; and therfore our Law which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon reaſon ſhall judge of it according to the open appearance of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he hath a grant made to him, and not according to the private capacity of the perſon, and this is not altered by the ſaid Statuts which is made in affirmation of it, and makes the authority of a Doctor of Law abſolute, not to be defeated by the Civill or Canon Law, which is not in the other caſe: But yet it doth not make this caſe of worſe condition then it was at Common Law. And by all the pleading of the Adminiſtration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Defendant, is not good, becauſe it appeareth by the date of it, that it was made after the day of the laſt continuance, and therfore could not have been pleaded untill a new continuance after: And by the Doctor the laſt Adminiſtration does not avoid the firſt, but in caſe where there is an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial revecation of the firſt: But they did not ſpeak of the doubleneſſe becauſe the Demurrer was generall and not ſpeciall, and alſo becauſe the other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſo cleer.</p>

And now the Plaintiff cannot ſay which part of the Hay is his, becauſe the one cannot be known from the other, and therfore the whole ſhall go to him who hath the property in it with which it is intermired, as if a man take my Garment and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider it with Silk, or Gold, or the like, I may take back my Garment, But if I take the Silk from you, and with this, face or embroider my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ſhall not take my Garment for your Silk which is in it, but are put to ſhe Action for taking of the Silk from you.</p>

But yet there is this diverſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſurrender of an Eſtate for life, and a ſurrender of an Eſtate in Fee to the uſe of a ſcranger, <hi>to wit,</hi> that by the one the Eſtate drowned in the Lord by the ſurrender, and by the other it is not drowned in the Lord, but is tranſferred to him to whom it was made, upon which he is admitted to it; otherwiſe, in the laſt caſe it returns to him who ſurrendred, and then upon the admittance he is in the <hi>Per</hi> by him who ſurrendred, and not by the Lord, or by the Surrender made by Tenant for life, he to whoſe uſe it is made ought to take it of the Lord, and he is there in by him, and not by him who ſurrendred.</p>
               <p>And this is the common difference betwixt Cuſtomary Eſtates for lives, and Cuſtomary Eſtates of Inheritance.</p>
               <p>And the Plaint of <hi>Cui in vita</hi> is given where recovery by default is againſt the husband and wife, and not upon the ſurrender of the husband; for ſuppoſe the husband had ſurrendred meerly to the Lord himſelf, yet the wife might have entred after the death of the husband, becauſe the ſurrender goes but to the Eſtate which the husband might lawfully part with, and therfore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be reſembled to a Grant then to a Feoffment.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding that he was not admitted, yet he might enter and take the profits, and make a Leaſe according to the cuſtom, or bring an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Treſpaſſe againſt him who diſturbes him? But if the Lord require his Fine or his Services, and the Heir refuſe to do them, this may be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of his Copyhold; But untill lawfull Seiſin made by the Lord (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belongeth to him) the Heir may intermeddle with the Poſſeſſion, albeit he be not admitted by the Lord where it is an Eſtate of Iuheritance by the Cuſtom.</p>

               <p>And by <hi>Popham,</hi> the caſe here is more cleer upon conſideration of the words of the Condition, for the words are, <hi>I the Defendant ſhall, or may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, &amp;c.</hi> and this word <hi>(may enjoy)</hi> ſhall be alwaies intended reaſonably, <hi>to wit,</hi> if it may without any thing to be done by him to the contrary; and here if he had not made the Surrender, he might have enjoyed the Scite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of his Term, and therfore becauſe it cometh of his own act, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he, or his Aſſigns ſhall not enjoy it for the Term, if it ſhall be ſaid, that he in the Reverſion ſhall not be ſaid in, by the Termor of which he himſelf ſhall not take any advantage, in as much as if this had not been, he might have enjoyed for the whole Term. To which all the other Iuſtices alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and upon this Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>But if any had defeated the ſaid Term by a lawfull entry, by a Title <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount,</hi> the Obligation had not been forfeited for any default of payment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Entry, but if Rent had been reſerved upon the Leaſe, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of payment, a Re-entry had been made, yet by <hi>Popham</hi> the payment ought to be continued upon the perill of the forfeiture of the Obligation, for the words <hi>(may enjoy)</hi> in as much as there it is the meer default of the Defendant himſelf, there the Leaſe does not continue, of which he ſhall not take advantage to ſave his Obligation. But note the form of the Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and that it might have been been better ioyned, which is to be ſeen in the Record where it is entred.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> late Sheriff of <hi>Devon;</hi> For that wheras <hi>John Chaunder alias Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deler,</hi> was in execution with the ſaid Sheriff for the ſaid ſumm, the ſaid Sheriff afterwards, <hi>to wit,</hi> the tenth day of <hi>December,</hi> 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in ſuch a Pariſh and Ward ſuffered him to eſcape, the ſaid <hi>Rigeway</hi> then being Sheriff of <hi>Devon,</hi> and having him then in execution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which the Defendant pleaded, how that he took him in Execution by the Proces at <hi>Stockram</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> as the Plaintiff hath alledged, and there detained him in ſafe cuſtody untill the <hi>8th.</hi> day of <hi>December,</hi> 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> at which day the ſaid <hi>Chaundeler</hi> broke the Priſon, and eſcaped out of it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the will of the ſaid Defendant, and that the Defendant did freſhly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him, and in this freſh purſuit did re-take him the <hi>11th.</hi> day of <hi>December,</hi> then next enſuing at <hi>Stockram</hi> aforeſaid, and detained him in execution for the ſaid 306 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> during the time of his Office, and delivered him ever to the new Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which the Plaintiff replyed by proteſtation, that he did not make freſh purſuit; And for plea ſaith, <hi>That after the going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the ſaid</hi> Chaundeler, <hi>and before his re-taking by the ſaid Defendant as aforeſaid, the ſaid</hi> Chaundeler <hi>for a whole day and night,</hi> to wit, at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>in the Pariſh and Ward aforeſaid, was out of the view of the ſaid Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> &amp;c. Vpon which it was demurred in Law.</p>
               <p>And it was moved by Cook Attorney-generall, that Iudgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff; for, in as much as it was alledged, that he was out of the view of the Sheriff for a day and a night together, there it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a default in the Defendant in the making of his purſuit, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chargable to the Plaintiff, and yet he agreed, that if the Sheriff had made his purſuit freſhly; although that at the turning of a Lane, end of a houſe, or the like, the Priſoner had been out of the view of the Sheriff for a ſmall time, as untill the Sheriff commeth to this turning, end of the houſe, or the like, yet the Sheriff may re-take the Priſoner, and he ſhall be yet ſaid to be in execution to the party againſt his will, yet when he is for ſo long a time out of his view, it ſhall be otherwiſe, for the default which the Law preſumes to be in him; and therfore in this caſe the action lies. To which it was anſwered by <hi>Popham, Gawdy,</hi> and <hi>Clench, That if he makes freſh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, ſo that it doth not appear fully that there was a default in the Sheriff in his purſuit, although he were ſo long out of his view, yet he ſhall be ſaid to be in execution for the party againſt his will upon the retaking of him: As if be be purſued to a houſe where he is kept for a long time, and the Sheriff ſet a guard upon the houſe, and after this re-take him the next, or any other day without departing from thence, the Sheriff in ſuch a caſe may re-take him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his coming out of the houſe, and he ſhall be in execution to the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo in all like Caſes; As if he purſues him in the night, ſo as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him, and yet by the tract of the horſe, or enquiry he makes diligent purſuit to re-take him, ſo that it cannot appear that there was any negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or default in him in making purſuit.</p>
               <p>And it is not the form of the pleading to alledge, that he purſued him freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had him alwaies in his view untill he re-took him, but only that he purſued him freſhly and took him in this freſh purſuit, without ſaying any thing that he was in his view, and therfore his being out of the view of the Sheriff is not materiall in the caſe, but the freſh purſuit, and the taking of him in this purſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53226:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then <hi>Coke</hi> moved, that the Bar was not good, becauſe he doth not ſhew where he made the purſuit, ſo that he might agres to anſwer that which is alledged by the Plaintiff, <hi>to wit,</hi> his being at large at <hi>London,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bar not being good, Iudgment ſhall be given againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for the inſufficiency of his Bar: for a Repleader ſhall not be in caſe of Demurs, as it hath been adjudged here very lately, and alſo in the Common Bench.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered by the ſaid Iuſtices, <hi>That if the Bar be inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in matter, ſo that it may appear by it, that the Plaintiff hath ſufficient cauſe of Action, which in matter is not ſufficiently avoided by the Bar, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be given for the Plaintiff upon the Bar, if the Replication be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and no Repleader; but if the Bar be ſufficient for the matter and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the form only, as it is here, there before the Statute of Eliz. for pleading there ſhall be a Repleader, but now becauſe no Demurrer was upon the Bar, but a Replication made to it, therfore by</hi> Popham <hi>no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhall be taken of the Bar for matter of form, which is admitted by the party, and no advantage taken therof according to the Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they all agreed, that the Sheriff, albeit he did not make freſh purſuit upon the eſcape, may yet take, re-take the Priſoner who eſcaped from him out of Execution, for the Priſoner ſhall not take advantage to avoid the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and therfore in reſpect of the Plaintiff, who yet may accept the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to be in execution, the Sheriff may re-take the Priſoner. But if the Plai. had recovered againſt the Sheriff before for the eſcape, then the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff for his Indempnity cannot re-take him, but is put to his Action upon the Caſe againſt the Priſoner, for the Sheriff hath no colour in ſuch a caſe of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape to retake him, but in reſpect, and for the advantage of the Plaintiff, who had Iudgment againſt the Priſoner, and not in reſpect of the private wrong done to himſelf, of which he hath no Iudgment, and as it is now, the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation not being good (by <hi>Popham)</hi> Iudgment ought to be given againſt the Plaintiff. But by aſſent it was ordered that the Defendant ſhall put in new Bail, and that upon it, he ſhall plead anew; But how ſhall it be if the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff do notmake freſh Suit and re-take him? And afterwards he, at whoſe Suit he was in Execution recovered againſt the Sheriff; may the Priſoner have an <hi>Audita querela</hi> upon the matter?</p>
               <p>Vpon an Aſſembly of all the Iuſtices at <hi>Serjeants-Inn</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> with the Barens of the Exchequer, it was cleerly agreed by them all (but two, who at the beginning made ſome doubt of it, but at the end aſſented alſo.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If in the night, the houſe of any be broken, with an intent to ſteal any thing being in the houſe, although no perſon be in the houſe at this time, yet this is Burglary, for the Law is, that every one ſhall be in ſecurity in the night, as well for their Goods as their perſons which be in the houſe.</hi>

                  <hi>And if a Church be broken in the night for the ſtealing of any thing in it, this is Burglary, though no perſon be in it at this time.</hi> And ſo hath the Law alwaies been put in execution, and in all the Books which ſpeak of Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is not mentioned that any perſon ought to be in the houſe, but that it is Burglary, the Meſſuage being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>IF men will enter into a due conſideration upon what grounds the Laws of this Realm have their Original Foundation, and what good effects are wrought through the due execution of the ſame they might ſay, and that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the profeſſion therof is both an honeſt, and honourable Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Laws are derived partly from the law of God and partly from the Law of Nature. From the Law of God, in that it ordaineth means how the people may be truly inſtructed in the knowledge and fear of God: How they ſhould demean themſelves towards their Soveraign and Prince: How they ought to live one with the other, and how to be defended from oppreſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. From the Law of Nature, in that it provideth how each man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, that he may live by his own labours, or otherwiſe according to his profeſſion or calling; That he may ſecure his Poſterity of that which he hath gathered together by his induſtry, and that man with man may live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſuch ſecure and comfortable Society as appertaineth. And what be the effects which grow by the due execution of the Laws? They are theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By it, God is known, the Soveraign Prince obeyed, the people are kept to live in peace, and that is yeilded to each which is his due: And can there be any better things then theſe upon the face of the Earth? No, there cannot. The Law therfore being taken from ſo good a ground, and working ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and honourable effects, who can juſtly ſay otherwiſe, but that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſuch a Law in an honourable profeſſion? Are not the Judges of the Law profeſſors of the Law? See then what God himſelf in his word hath ſaid of Judges in Pſal.</hi> 82. <hi>ſpeaking of Judgment and Juſtices he ſaith thus; I have ſaid yee are Gods, and can there be any higher name then this in Heaven or Earth? And why are they ſo learned? but for that, they in their Offices do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that which is the Office of God, as to diſcern ſo far forth as mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity can reach unto between right and wrong, truth and falſhood, the juſt and the unjuſt, which is a moſt high, weighty and honourable charge, and therfore</hi> 2 <hi>Chro:</hi> 196. <hi>cha. Jehoſophat ſaid to the Judges, Take heed what you do, for you do not execute the Judgments of men, but of the Lord, and He will be with you in Judgment. By which it is evident, that they are either groſly ignorant, or otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this I may truly ſay to the encouragement and comfort of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honeſt do profeſs the Law<hi>:</hi> That in the moſt parts of <hi>England</hi> there are more Gentlemens houſes, and thoſe of continuance raiſed and advanced by that profeſſion alone, then by all other the profeſſions that can be ſpoken of, and approved,.</p>
               <p>Let any man of Experience in the State, of the generall part of the Realm enter into a due conſideration of it, and I am well aſſured he ſhall find it ſo; wherby it may plainly appear, that Gods bleſſings for worldly benefits have greatly abounded towards ſuch as have walked evenly and juſtly in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: yet happily there may be ſome (I mean ſuch as ſlip in by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means) that ſomtime do give ſcandall to the Profeſſion; as where ſuch are called to the Degrees of Learning, as are either ignorant, or infamous perſons, wherby they either cannot adviſe as they ſhould, or by giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to ſlights and to ſhifts, they do not adviſe as they ought.</p>
               <p>A matter abhorred of all good and honeſt men: But the ſame being duly weighed, tendeth to the touch of the perſon, and not of the Profeſſion. Nevertheleſs to avoid this Scandall, I would adviſe;</p>
               <p>1. Such as have Government in theſe houſes of Court, ſhould be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and reſpective in their Calls, not only to the bench as Readers, but of thoſe alſo whom they call to the Bar, that they may be ſuch as may appear to be both learned, and honeſt, and ſuch as may not juſtly be impeached of Ignorance, or Ignominy; for ſuch are not only to adviſe between parties, but many of them are drawn to Credit and Government alſo in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and therfore behoofull to be free from ſuch Imputations.</p>
               <p>And ſithence without the knowledge of the Law in ſome meaſure, ſuch as govern in their Countries, may often fall to commit ſuch Errors as were to be wiſhed might be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>It were convenient that Gentlemen, yea, thoſe of beſt worth would bring up their very heirs in the knowledge of the Laws, as that they might in after ages, when as they ſhall be called to Government, be ſo able to govern under her Majeſty as might beſt ſtand with their Reputations, and the good of their Countries.</p>
               <p>And now your ſelves that are here preſent, and have been called to this State and Degree of Serjeants at Law (a State and Degree I may well call it, for that her Majeſty doth ſo term it) Since your gravities and your good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in your callings hither-to, and the good opinion conceived of your Learnings, Experiences, and Diſcretions hath moved her Majeſty to call you to this Dignity.</p>
               <p>I am now to adviſe you ſo to demean and govern your ſelves in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as thoſe good things thus conceived of you may not henceforth any waies be blemiſhed, but rather encreaſe, to your further Reputations and Credits. In which you are to have a ſpeciall regard that you be thankfull, firſt, to God, who hath ſo guided the courſe of your lives hither-to, as it hath made you to have been thought to have merited this Advancement. Then to her Majeſty, who upon good report made, hath conceived ſo well of you as to call you to this Degree, wherin it behoveth you ſo to demean your ſelves, as in all her Highneſs Service, both in your Countries and otherwiſe, as you ſhall be called therunto, as you may be found to deal therin effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, diligently, and juſtly.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to the Country and Common wealth who hath carried ſo good a report of you, as therby you have been the rather brought to this place<hi>:</hi> And the moſt thankfulneſs you can ſhew to your Country, is, to Councell your Clients according to your skill honeſtly, and truly, wherby they may not be encouraged to ſpend their time and their ſubſtance in vain, frivolous, and unjuſt Suits; to be faithfull and ſecret to your Clients, not diſcloſing their Councels to their prejudice, that you expedite your Clients Cauſe

ſo far forth with conveniency, and your Clients ſafety, that both in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and otherwiſe, your ſpeech and behaviour towards all men be modeſt and diſcreet, yea, ſuch as appertaineth to men of your Gravities and Callings, that without reſpect of perſons, yea, be bold to maintain your Clients honeſt Cauſe, ſo far forth as may ſtand with knowledge and diſcretion<hi>:</hi> And that in all things you reſpect more your honeſties, then your profits.</p>
               <p>And touching theſe points, you have a continuall memory, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies about you, in your very Garments: And therfore by the Coif, in reſpect it is white many things are ſignified, as Gravity, Wiſdom, and Experience, for that theſe Virtues are proper to the gray haires, and white headed men.</p>
               <p>There is alſo ſignified therby, that you ſhould be both honeſt and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted life; And in that it is faſhioned like a Helmet, it ſignifieth, that you ſhould be both bold to utter your knowledge in the Law, in the honeſt and juſt cauſe of your Client, without reſpect of perſons whomſoever it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And by the party colour'd Garments, being both of deep colours, and ſuch as the Judges themſelves in ancient time uſed (for ſo we receive it by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſignified ſoundneſs and depth of judgment and ability to diſcerne of Cauſes, what colour ſoever be caſt over it, and under, or with what vail or ſhadow ſoever it be diſguiſed. For the wholneſs and cloſneſs of your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they do ſignifie integrity to be uſed in your advices, and ſecrecy in your councels. And in that the Garments being ſingle and unlined, it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth that you ſhould be ſincere and plain in your adviſes, and not double, carrying your opinion to your ſelf one way, and you adviſe it your Client clean another way.</p>
               <p>The two Tongues do ſignifie, that as you ſhould have one Tongue for the Rich for your Fee, as a reward for your long ſtudies and labours, ſo ſhould you alſo have another Tongue as ready without reward to defend the Poor and Oppreſſed; And therin to ſhew your ſeves thankfull to God for all that which he hath beſtowed upon you.</p>
               <p>And for the Rings you give, as Gold is amongſt all Mettals the pureſt, ſo ſhould you be of all others of your Profeſſion the perfecteſt both in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and in the other Virtues before remembred: And in that it is a Ring, and round without end, it betokeneth that you have made a perpetuall Vow to this your Profeſſion and Calling, and are as it were wedded unto it<hi>:</hi> And therfore I heartily wiſh you may alwaies walk therin according as appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to your Calling.</p>

               <p>4. IN an Action upon the Caſe by <hi>Rice Edwards</hi> againſt <hi>Edward Halinder;</hi> The Plaintiff declared by his Bill that one <hi>Edward Baniſter</hi> was ſeiſed in his Demeſne as of Fee, of a Meſſuage in ſuch a Pariſh and Ward in <hi>London,</hi> and being ſo ſeiſed did let to him the Cellar of the ſame houſe the 23. day of <hi>April,</hi> 32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for a week, from the ſame day, and ſo from week to week, ſo long as the parties ſhould pleaſe, at ſuch a Rent by the week, wherby he was poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>And further, that the ſaid <hi>Edward Baniſter</hi> being ſeiſed of the ſaid houſe, as is aforeſaid, afterwards, <hi>to wit,</hi> 29. <hi>July,</hi> in the 32. year aforeſaid, gave to the ſaid Defendant <hi>Officium, Anglice,</hi> the Warehouſe of the ſaid Meſſuage being right over the ſaid Cellar, for a week from thenceforth, and ſo from week to week, ſo long as the parties ſhould pleaſe, paying ſuch a Rent, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Defendant was therof poſſeſſed accordingly: And the Plaintiff being poſſeſſed of the ſaid Cellar, and the Defendant of the Warehouſe, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and the Plaintiff then having in the ſaid Cellar three Butts of Sack to the value of 40 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> The Defendant the 30: day of <hi>July</hi> in the 32. year aforeſaid, put ſuch a quantity of weight and burthen of Merchandize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaid Warehouſe, and therby did ſo overburthen the floor of the ſaid Warehouſe, ſo that by the force and weight of the ſaid burthen, the ſaid floor the ſaid 30. day of <hi>July</hi> was broken, and by force therof did fall, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Merchandize that were in the ſaid Warehouſe did fall out of the ſaid Warehouſe into the ſaid Cellar upon the ſaid Veſſels of Wine, and by force therof brake the ſaid Veſſels of Wine, wherby the ſaid Wine did flye out of the ſaid Veſſels, and became of no value, to the Plaintiffs damage of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which the Defendant ſaith, <hi>That within a ſmall time before the Treſpaſſe committed, the floor of the ſaid Warehouſe ſuſtained as great a burthen of Merchandize as this was<hi>:</hi> And that the Warehouſe was demiſed to him as the Plaintiff hath alledged to lay in it</hi> 30. <hi>Tun weight, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was poſſeſſed, and ſo poſſeſſed the ſaid</hi> 30. <hi>day of July, did put into the ſaid Warehouſe but</hi> 14. <hi>Tun weight of Merchandize, and that the damages which the Plaintiff had by the breaking of the floor, was, becauſe the floor at the time of the laying of the merchandiſe upon it, &amp; alſo before the leaſe made to him therof was ſo rotten, and a great part of the Wall upon which the ſaid floor lyes, ſo much decayed, that for default of Reparations and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therof by thoſe to whom the reparations did belong, before the Leaſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made, it ſuddainly brake, which matter he is ready to aver;</hi> Wherupon the Plaintiff demurred, and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff in the Exchequer, upon which a Writ of Error was brought in the Exchequer Chamber, and the Error aſſigned was, that the Iudgment ought to have been given for the Defendant, becauſe that now it appeareth that there was not any default in the Defendant, for he was not to repair that which was ſo ruinous at the time of his Leaſe, and therfore if it did bear ſo much lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it cannot fall by the default of the Defendant in the weight put upon it, but by the ruinouſnes of the thing demiſed; And yet by the advice of the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Iudgment was this Term affirmed: for the Plaintiff hath alledged expreſly, that the floor brake by the weight of the Merchandize put upon it. which ought to be confeſſed and avoided, or traverſed; wheras here he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers but argumentatively, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it did bear more before, therfore that he did not break it by this weight, or that it was ſo ruinous that it brake, <hi>Ergo</hi> not by the weight<hi>:</hi> wheras here it is expreſly alledged, that it brake by the weight put upon it, and if leſſer weight had been put it would not have broken. And he who takes ſuch a ruinous houſe ought to mind well what weight he put into it at his perill, ſo that it be not ſo much that another ſhall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53226:28"/>
take any damage by it: But if it had fallen of it ſelf without any weight put upon it, or that it had fallen by the default only of the poſts in the Cellar which ſupport the floor, with which the Defendant had nothing to do, there the Defendant ſhall be excuſed? But here it is expreſly alledged, that it fell by the weight put upon it, which ought to be anſwered: As if a man take an Eſtate for life, or years in a ruinous houſe, if he pull it down he ſhall be charged in Waſt, but if it fall of it ſelf, he ſhall be excuſed in Waſt; ſo there is a diverſity where default is in the party, and where not, ſo here, the Defendant ought to have taken good care, that he did not put upon ſuch a ruinous floor more then it might well bear, &amp; if it would not bear any thing, he ought not to put any thing into it, to the prejudice of a third perſon, and if he does, he ſhall anſwer to the party his damages.</p>

And it was moved by <hi>Heale</hi> that the Plaintiff ought to be barred, becauſe it did not paſſe by way of Eſtate, in as much as a man cannot paſſe a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of a Land from himſelf to begin at a time to come, and by it to create a particular Eſtate to himſelf, and in uſe it cannot paſſe, becauſe that by a bare parole and Vſe cannot be raiſed, and by giving my Land to my Son, Coſin, and the like, nothing will paſſe without Livery, for there is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to raiſe an Vſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fennor,</hi> The words ſhall be taken, as if he had ſaid <hi>(here I give you this</hi> Barton <hi>reſerving an Eſtate for my life)</hi> although the words of reſervation have priority in their time from the ſpeaking of them, becauſe a reſervation cannot be but out of a thing granted, and therfore the reſervation ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, or otherwiſe ought to be taken according to their proper nature, <hi>to wit,</hi> to be in their operation ſubſequent, and ſo ſhall not hurt the Grant, and therfore are not to be compared to the caſe where a man grant that after the death of <hi>I.

                  <hi>Mich.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which is a good caſe to this purpoſe: But to ſay ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that an Vſe cannot be raiſed or charged upon a perfect Contract by words upon good conſideration, cannot be Law; and therfore it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what the Law was before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And I thinke that none will deny, but that by grant of Land for money, before this Statute an Vſe was raiſed out of the ſame Land, for a bargain and ſale of Land for money, and a grant of Land for money is all one, and no difference between them<hi>:</hi> And is not a grant of Land made in conſideration of marriage of my Son and Daughter, as valuable as a grant of it for money? It is cleer that it is, and much more valuable, as my blood is more valuable to me then my money; and therfore it is abſurd to ſay, that the conſideration of money raiſe or change an Vſe at Common Law, and not ſuch a conſideration of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>And in ſuch a caſe at Common Law there was not any diverſity, that the party who ſo grant or hargain for the one or the other conſiderations was f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that the Law was ſo, it appeareth by the Statute of Inrolements of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and ſales of Land made 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which enacts, that no Freehold, nor Vſe therof ſhall paſſe by bargain and ſale only, unleſſe it be by deed indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enrolled according to the Statute; <hi>Ergo,</hi> if this Statute had not been, it had paſſed by the bargain and ſale by bare words; and in as much as the Statute enacts this in caſe of bargain and ſale only, the other caſes, as this caſe here, are as it was before at Common Law. And by an exception at the end of the ſame Statute, <hi>London</hi> is as it was at Common Law, and therfore now Lands may paſſe there at this day by bargain and ſale, by word without deed, for it is out of the Statute: And how can we ſay, that the Statute of Vſes does any thing to alter the Common Law in this point, by any intent of the makers therof, wheras at the ſame Parliament they made an eſpeciall Law in the caſe of bargain and ſale of Lands. And at this day, for the Lands in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding the Statute of Vſes, the Law hath been put in practice, and alwaies holden as to the Lands there to be good, if ſold by bare Parole as it were at Common Law. And I have heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Manwood</hi> late chief Baron of the Exchequer, that it was in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> whether the uſe of a Freehold of Land will paſſe upon a Contract by Parole without Deed in conſideration of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; upon which all the then Iuſtices were aſſembled upon a doubt riſing in a caſe, hapning in the Star-chamber, and then reſolved by all the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as he ſaid) that it ſhall paſſe; and he ſaid, that himſelf was of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion alſo: And to ſay, that by grant of Land at Common Law, the uſe had been raiſed out of the poſſeſſions of the Land which the Grantor then had, and by it paſſe to the Bargainee, and that it ſhall not be raiſed and paſſed to another by grant of Land in conſideration of marriage, which is a more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration then money, is abſurd and againſt all reaſon.</p>
               <p>And for the ſolemnity, Vſes in ſuch caſes (in reſpect of marriage) were the cauſe that they alwaies were left as they were at Common Law, and not reſtrained as the caſe of bargain and ſale is, which by Common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be made more eaſily and ſecretly, then that which is done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of marriage, which is alwaies a thing publike and notorious, but it is not reaſonable that every ſlight or accidentall ſpeech ſhall make an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any Vſe: As if a man ask of any one what he will give or leave to any of his Sons or Daughters for their advancement in marriage, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their advancement, this ſhall be but as a bare ſpeech or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53226:29"/>
which ſhall not alter or change any Vſe: But where there is upon the Speech a concluſion of a Marriage between the friends of the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that in conſideration therof, they ſhall have ſuch Lands, and for ſuch an Eſtate, there the Vſe ſhall be raiſed by it, and ſhall paſſe accordingly to the parties, according to the concluſion which <hi>Fennor</hi> granted.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Popham,</hi> If it may be taken upon the words ſpoken, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to have the Eſtate paſſe by way of making of an Eſtate, as by way of Feoffment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then notwithſtanding the conſideration expreſſed, the uſe ſhall not change, nor no Eſtate by it but at will, untill the Livery made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: And therfore if a man make a Deed of Feoffment, with expreſſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of marriage, although the Deed hath words in it of <hi>Dedi &amp; Conceſſi,</hi> with a Letter of Attorney to make Livery therupon, there untill Livery made nothing paſſe but at will, becauſe that by the Warrant of Attorney, it appeareth the full intent of the parties was, that it ſhall paſſe by way of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment, and not otherwiſe, if it be of Land in poſſeſſion<hi>:</hi> And if it be of Land in Leaſe, not untill Attornment of Tenants, which was granted by all the Iuſtices.</p>
               <p>But if a man in conſideration of money makes a Deed of Gift, Grant, Bargain, and Sale of his Lands to another, and his Heirs by Deed indented, with a Letter of Attorny to make Livery, if Livery be therupon made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inrolement, there it hath been adjudged to paſſe by the Livery, and not by the Inrolement.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Popham,</hi> where Land is to paſſe in poſſeſſion by Eſtate executed, two things are requiſite: The one, the grant of the ſaid Land, the other, the Livery to be made therupon, for by the bare Grant without Livery, it doth not paſſe as by way of making of an Eſtate: And this is the cauſe that ſuch ſolemnity hath been uſed in Liveries, <hi>to wit,</hi> if it were of a Meſſuage, to have the people out of it, and then to give Seiſin to the party by the Ring of the door of the Houſe, and of Land by a Turff and a Twig, and the like, which may be notorious: Yet I agree it ſhall be a good Livery to ſay to the party, <hi>Here is the Land, enter into it, and take it to you and your Heirs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or for life, or in tail, as the caſe is;</hi> And albeit Livery by the View may be made in ſuch manner, yet by the ſealing of the Deed of Grant upon the Land, or by grant of it upon the Land without Livery, nothing paſſe but at will. But if therupon one party ſaith to the other after the Grant, or upon it, <hi>Here is the Land, enter upon it, and take it according to the Grant,</hi> this is a good Livery: But he ought to ſay this, or ſomthing which amounts to ſo much, or otherwiſe it ſhall not paſſe by the bare Grant of the Land, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be made upon the Land. <hi>Clench</hi> ſaid, <hi>That when</hi> Thomas <hi>ſaid to</hi> Euſtace, <hi>Stand forth, here I do give to thee and thine Heirs theſe Lands,</hi> this amounts to a Grant and a Livery alſo; and by the words of the Reſervation of the Eſtate to himſelf, and his wife for their lives, in this the Law ſhall make an uſe in the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> and his wife for their lives: ſo that by ſuch means it ſhal enure, as if he had reſerved the uſe therof to him and his wife, and ſo it ſhall enure to them as it may by the Law according to his intent, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudice to the Eſtate paſſed to the ſaid <hi>Euſtace:</hi> And afterwards <hi>Term Mich.</hi> 36, <hi>&amp;</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was again diſputed amongſt the Iuſtices, and then <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Caſe of Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it is agreed there, that the conſideration of nature is the moſt forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration which can be, and agreed alſo that a bare Covenant by writing without conſideration, will not change an Vſe, therfore the force therof is in the conſideration, of which the Law hath great reſpect: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son and Heir apparant <hi>ex aſſenſu patris,</hi> onely may at the door of the Church endow his wife of his Fathers Land, which he hath in Fee, and this is good by <hi>Littleton,</hi> although the Son hath nothing in it, wherby an Eſtate paſſe to the wife, which is more then an Vſe.

               <p>To which <hi>Clench</hi> alſo aſſented, but <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, <hi>That by the entry for the Condition, the Charge is defeated:</hi> And therfore we are to conſider upon the ground of <hi>Littleton</hi> in his Chapter of Confirmation, to what effect a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation ſhall enure, and this is to bind the right of him who makes the Confirmation, but not to alter the nature of the Eſtate of him to whom the Confirmation is made; And therfore in the caſe of a grant of a Rent-charge by the Diſſeiſor, which is confirmed by the Demiſee: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Confirmation ſhall make this good, is, becauſe that as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee hath right to defeat the right and the Eſtate of the Diſſeiſor by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, in the ſame manner hath he right therby to avoid a Charge, or a Leaſe granted by the Diſſeiſor, which Right for the time may be bound by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. But when a man hath an Eſtate upon condition, although the Feoffor, or his Heirs confirm this Eſtate, yet by this the Eſtate is not alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to the Condition, but it alwaies remaineth, and therfore <hi>Nihil ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur</hi> by ſuch a confirmation to prejudice the Condition. And ſo there is a great diverſity, when hewho confirmeth, hath right to the Land, and where but a Condition in the Land. And by him, if a Feoffee upon condition make a Feoffment over, or a Leaſe for life or years, every one of theſe have their Eſtates ſubject to the Condition; and therfore by a Confirmation made to them, none can be excluded from the Condition: And the ſame reaſon is in caſe of a Rent granted by a Feoffor upon Condition, it is alſo ſubject to the Condition, and therfore not excluded from it by the Confirmation, as it ſhall be in caſe of a Right.</p>
               <p>And to prove this diverſity, ſuppoſe there be Grand-father, Father, and Son, the Father diſſeiſe the Grand-father, and makes a Feoffment upon Condition, and dies, after which the Grand-father dies, now the Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Eſtate of the Feoffee, by this he hath excluded himſelf from the Right which deſcended to him by his Grand-father, but not to the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which deſcended to him from his Father.</p>
               <p>And of this opinion were <hi>Anderſon</hi> and other Iuſtices at <hi>Serjeants-Inn</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> for the principall Caſe upon the Caſe moved there, by <hi>Popham</hi> this Term: And as the caſe is, it would have made a good queſtion upon the Statute of <hi>Fraudulent Conveyances,</hi> if the Avowry had been made as by the grant of <hi>Thomas May,</hi> in as much as the Eſtate made to the uſe of <hi>Dennis,</hi> was defeaſable at the pleaſure of the ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> in as much as it was made by the Tenant of the Land, as well as by him who made the Conveyance, which is to be judged fraudulent upon the Statute. But this as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was, cannot come in queſtion in this caſe: And afterwards by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of other three Iudges, Iudgment was given that the Grant ſhould bind the ſaid <hi>Thomas May,</hi> and his Feoffees after him, notwithſtanding his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe made by the Condition, in as much as the Grant of the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhall enure to the Grantee by way of confirmation.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Gawdy, If a Feoffee upon Condition make a Feoffment over, and the firſt Feoffor confirm the Eſtate of the laſt Feoffee, he ſhall hold the Land diſcharged of the Condition, becauſe his Feoffment was made abſolutely without any Condition expreſſed in his Feoffment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Popham</hi> denied this, as it appeareth by <hi>Littleton Tit. Deſcents,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath his Eſtate ſubject to the ſame Condition, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as his Feoffor hath it, into whomſoever hands it hapneth to come, and therfore the Confirmation ſhall not diſcharge the Condition, but is only to bind the right of him who made it in the poſſeſſion of him to whom it is made but not upon Condition.</p>

H.</hi> 8. enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offed <hi>Edward, late</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> therof, by their Deed, hearing date the 21. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1. <hi>E.</hi> 6. who afterwards dyed, and the now Lord <hi>North</hi> entred, and did let it to the Plaintiff, who was ouſted by the Defendant, claiming the ſaid Houſe by a Leaſe made by the ſaid Dean and Chapter in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for divers years yet to come, and whether his entry were lawfull, or not, was the queſtion, and all depends upon the miſ-naming of the Corporation: But it was found that the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> were all one, and that the Town of <hi>Oxford</hi> was made a City by the Charter of King <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Fennor,</hi> the Feoffment made to <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North,</hi> for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naming of the Corporation, was void, for he ſaid, that <hi>Accademia &amp; villa de Oxford,</hi> are divers in name, and divers in nature, for the Vniverſity is to the Schollars and learned men there, and the Town for the Inhabitants, and the name of a place is a principal thing in a Corporation, which in a new Corporation ought to be preciſe, according to the very Letter of the Charter therof: And therfore in the caſe of <hi>Cheſter</hi> it was agreed, that <hi>Ceſtria</hi> being omitted, the Charter for the Dean and Chapter there had been void.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Popham, Gawdy,</hi> and <hi>Clench,</hi> this is not ſuch a miſ-naming as to the place which ſhall make the Feoffment void: for ſuppoſe it had been <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus &amp; Capitalis Eccleſiae Cathedralis Chriſti in Civitate Oxon.</hi> it had been good, for <hi>Oxon. &amp; Civitas Oxon.</hi> are one and the ſame. So it is if an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall be erected by the name of the Hoſpitall of S. <hi>Johns</hi> in S. <hi>Clements;</hi> and they make a Grant by the name of the Hoſpitall of S. <hi>Johns</hi> in the Pariſh of S. <hi>Clements,</hi> it is good, for it appeareth to be the ſame: And here if a man will ſay, that it ſhall go to the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> this every one conceives to be the Town of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and therfore in 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to be a good addition for the place in an Action perſonall, againſt ſuch a one Chancellor of the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo it is againſt <hi>J.</hi> Rector of the Pariſh Church of <hi>Dale,</hi> without any other addition for the place, yet the Statute is, that it ought to be named of what Town, Hamlet, or place the party is. And by <hi>Popham,</hi> the place in a Corporation may well be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the Sur-name of a man, and as a Grant made by any perſons Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name, as <hi>John, Thomas, &amp;c:</hi> is not good, ſo in a Corporation it is not good to ſay, Dean, and Chapter, Mayor, and Comminalty, and the like,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53226:33"/>
without ſaying, of what place: And anciently men took moſt commonly their Surnames from their places of habitation, eſpecially men of Eſtate, and Artizans often took their names from their Arts, but yet the Law is not ſo preciſe in the caſe of Sur-names, and therfore a Grant made by, or to <hi>John,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>I. C.</hi> or <hi>Filio juniori I. S.</hi> is good: But for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name, this alwaies ought to be perfect.</p>
               <p>So in the caſe of a Corporation, it ſufficeth to have a ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place where the Corporation is, albeit it be not by the preciſe words compriſed in the Charter: as in naming <hi>Accademia Oxon. pro Villa Oxon,</hi> and it is common, of which I have ſeen divers Charters, where a Town was incorporated by the name of <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Comminalty</hi> of ſuch a Town, as <hi>Briſtoll, Exeter,</hi> and others, which afterwards have been made Cities, and yet Charters made to them, and Grants made by them, by the name of <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Comminalty</hi> of the City is good, but more preciſeneſſe is vſed in the body of the name of a Corporation before the place to which they are annexed, and yet in them, that which is but an ornament to the name comprehended in the Charter, ſhall not hurt the Grant, as of Chapiter, of S. <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> if it be of S. <hi>George</hi> the Martyr, and the like, the Grant by ſuch a name is good, becauſe the <hi>Martyr</hi> is but an addition of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the name compriſed in the Charter, and it is no other but the ſame in <hi>re vera.</hi> So here, if it had been <hi>Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> becauſe it is the ſame, and is but an ornament to the word Chriſt compriſed in the Charter, and ſo ſhould it be alſo if it had been <hi>Chriſti filii Dei Salvatoris no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri,</hi> becauſe it is but a true addition to the ſame; wherupon Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, as appeareth in the Kings Bench, <hi>Paſ.</hi> 35 <hi>E.

               <p>And <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid further in this caſe, that to erect an Hoſpitall by the name of an Hoſpitall, in the County of <hi>S.</hi> or in the Biſhopprick of <hi>B.</hi> and the like, is not good, becauſe he is bound to a place too large, and incertain: But a Colledge erected in <hi>Accademia Cantabrig.</hi> or <hi>Oxon.</hi> is good, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

3. In this Term I hapned to ſee a Caſe agreed by the Iuſtices in 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If a man make a Leaſe of two Barns, rendring Rent, and for default of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Re-entry, if the Tenant be at one of the Barns to pay the Rent, and the Leſſor at the other to demand the Rent, and none be there to pay it, that yet the Leſſor cannot enter for the Condition broken, becauſe there was no default in the Tenant, he being at one, for it was not poſſible for him to be at both places together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this Caſe now remembred to the Iuſtices, <hi>Popham, Walmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and <hi>Fennor</hi> ſaid, <hi>That perhaps alſo the Tenant had not money ſufficient to have been ready to have paid it, at either of the ſaid places, but it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him to have and provide one Rent, which cannot be at two places together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the Caſe reported here alſo; <hi>If Lands and Woods are demiſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Rent ought to be demanded at the Land, and not the Woood, becauſe the Land is the more worthy thing, and alſo more open then the Wood:</hi> And therfore by the three Iuſtices aforeſaid, Rent ought not to be demanded in any private place of a Cloſe, as amongſt Buſhes, in a Pit, or the like, nor in the open and moſt uſuall paſſage therof, as at a Stile, Gate, and the like.</p>
               <p>4. Vpon a Prohibition ſued out of the Kings Bench, the Caſe appeared to be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The late Lord</hi> Rich, <hi>Father to the now Lord</hi> Rich <hi>deviſed, to his Daughter, for her advancement in marriage</hi> 1500. <hi>upon condition, that ſhe marry with the conſent of certain friends, and deviſeth further, that if his Goods and Chattels are not ſufficient to pay his Debts and Legacies, that then there ſhall be</hi> 200 <hi>l. a year of his Lands ſold to ſupply it, and dies, making the now Lord</hi> Rich <hi>his Executor, his Goods and Chattels not being ſufficient to pay the Debts of the Teſtator, as was averred, the ſaid Daughter married with a Husband againſt the will of thoſe who were put in truſt to give their aſſents; and the Husband and the Wife ſued in the Spirituall Court for the Legacy: And it was ſurmiſed that they would not allow the proofs of the ſaid now Lord</hi> Rich, <hi>exhihited to prove the payment of the Debts of his Teſtator; and further, that they would charge him for the ſale of the Land; upon which matter the Prohibition was granted to the Delegates, before whom the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depended, and now conſultation was prayed in the caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon which it was affirmed by a Doctor of the Civill Law, that they will allow the proofs for the payment of the Debts, according to our Law, and that the Legacy ſhall not be paid untill the Debs are ſatiſfied. But he ſaid, that by the Law, if the Executor do not exhibit his Inventory, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it for a year, or more, that then if any omiſſion or default be in the true value of the Inventory exhibited, that then ſuch on Executor for this default ſhall pay all the Legacies of his Teſtator, of what value ſoever they are, not reſpecting the Debts, or the value of the Goods or Chattels, how ſmall ſoever the omiſſion, or default be in the Inventory; And ſo he ſaid was the caſe of the now Sir <hi>Richard S.</hi> who did not bring in the Inventory for four years after the death of the Teſtator, and that in the Inventory exhibited, the values of every thing were found to be too ſmall, and therfore to be charged by their Law, albeit he hath not Goods and Chattels ſufficient of the Teſtators. To which it was anſwered, that this was quite without reaſon, for by ſuch means every Subject of the Realm may be utterly defeated, if he take upon him the charge of an Executorſhip: And if this ſhall be admitted, no man will take upon him the Execution of the Will of any, and by ſuch a means none will have their Wills performed, which ſhall be too inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53226:34"/>
And they ſaid further, that in as much as Debts are to be proved by the Common Law of the Realm, thoſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts ought to admit in the proof therof, ſuch proofs as our Law allows, and not according to the preciſeneſſe of their Law<hi>:</hi> And although by their Law ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as before being annexed to a Legacy, is void, becauſe that marriage oughr to be free without Coercion, yet where we are to judge upon the point (as we are here) if the Execution happen to be charged becauſe of the ſale of Land, and for the money coming therof, a prohibition ſhall be granted to the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge in ſuch a caſe, wherby the Court granted a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſultation in the Caſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they proceed for the Legacy, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they charge the Executor no further then he hath in Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the Teſtator, after his true and due Debts are ſatisfied: And that in the caſe of the proof of theſe Debts, they allow ſuch proofs as by the Law of the Land are holden to be ſufficient in ſuch a caſe; <hi>Quod nota ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> for breaking his Cloſe at <hi>North Luffenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> upon not guilty, and a ſpeciall Verdict, the Caſe appeared to be this, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the Plaintiff was <hi>Rector Eccleſiae de North Luffenham</hi> aforeſaid, of which the place was parcell, and being ſo ſeiſed, was deprived of his Rectory by the late Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and his Colleagues, by virtue of the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to them and others diverted, becauſe he had pronounced and uttered ſlanderous and contumelious words againſt, and in depravation of the Book of <hi>Common-prayer;</hi> But the form of the ſentence was, that the ſaid Biſhop by, and with the aſſent and conſent of five others of the ſaid Commiſſioners his Companions, and namely which deprived him.</p>
               <p>And further, it was not found, that the Commiſſioners named were the naturall Subjects born of the Queen, as the Statute enacts that they ſhould be: And if the deprivation be void, then they find the Defendant guilty, and if it were good, then they find him not guilty. And it was moved that the deprivation was void.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe that wheras the Commiſſion is to them, or any three of them, of which the ſaid Biſhop to be one amongſt others, it ought to have been the ſentence of them all, according to the authority given to them, which is equall, and not that it was done by one with aſſent of the other. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not found that the Commiſſioners are the naturall Subjects of the Queen born, as by the words of the Statute they ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Another is, becauſe the puniſhment which the Statute provides for thoſe of the Miniſtry which deprave this Book, is to looſe the profits of all their Spirituall Promotions but for a year, and to be impriſoned by the ſpace of ſix months, and not to be deprived untill the ſecond Offence, after that he had been once committed, and therfore to deprive him for the firſt offence was wrongfull and contrary to the Statute. But by the whole Court for the form of the deprivation, it is, that which is uſed in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, which alway names the chief in Commiſſion, that are preſent at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sentence, and for the other they mention them only as here, but of their aſſent and conſent to it, and in ſuch caſes we ought to give credit to their form, and therfore tis not to be compared to an authority given at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Law by Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53226:35"/>
And for the matter that is not found, that the Commiſſioners were the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Subjects of the Queen born, it is to be intended that they were ſuch, unleſſe the contrary appear: But here at the beginning it is found that the Queen, <hi>ſecundum tenorem &amp; effectum actus predict.</hi> had granted her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to them <hi>in cauſis Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> and therfore it appeareth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were ſuch as the Statute wills them to be.</p>
               <p>And for the deprivation, they all agreed that it was good, being done by the authority of the Commiſſion, for the Statute is to be underſtood where they proſecute upon the Statute by way of Inditement, and not to reſtrain the Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, being alſo but in the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>And further by the Act and their Commiſſion, they may proceed according to their diſcretion to puniſh the offence proved or confeſſed before them, and ſo are the words of their Commiſſion warranted by the clauſe of the Act.</p>
               <p>And further, the Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction is ſaved in the Act.</p>
               <p>And further, all the Biſhops and Popiſh Prieſts were deprived by virtue of a Commiſſion warranted by this clauſe in the Act: And now lately it was agreed by all the Iuſtices, that a Fine of 200. marks ſet upon one for a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liver by the high commiſſion was warranted by virtue of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Act: And therfore if the Act with the Commiſſion, are to be conſder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this caſe, wherupon it was agreed that the Plaintiff ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his Writ: <hi>Which you may ſee, Hill.</hi> 33. <hi>Eliz.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53226:36"/>
which the Defendant by commandment of the ſaid <hi>Arthur,</hi> and with him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Plaintiff; and the generall queſtion was, Whether the entry of the Defendant were lawfull? But no <hi>ouſter</hi> of the Plaintiff was found.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Clench,</hi> and <hi>Fennor,</hi> a Fee-ſimple paſſe at Common Law by a Fine levied by him in Reverſion, or Remainder in Tail, becauſe a Fine is ſaid to be a Feoffment of Record, and by their entry and Feoffment a Fee-ſimple paſſe in ſuch a caſe at Common Law.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Popham,</hi> and <hi>Gaudy,</hi> a Fee-ſimple doth not paſſe, nor nothing but that which Tenant in Tail may lawfully grant over, which is for his life, in which he ſaid, that <hi>Littleton</hi> was plain in all caſes of Grant, although it be by Fine, and a Fee-ſimple does not paſſe at Common Law, but where the Fee may be drawn out of him who had the Reverſion or Remainder in Fee therupon, if ſuch a Reverſion or Remainder had been in a ſtranger, which had not been in this caſe, if the Reverſion or Remainder had been in a ſtranger; and therfore a Diſcontinuance cannot be of an Intail where the Reverſion or Remainder is in the King.</p>
               <p>But by them all, however it was at Common Law, it is cleer upon the Statute of Fines, that a Fee-ſimple determinable paſſe by ſuch a Fine as ſoon as the Fine is levied, becauſe every Fine by preſumption of Law ſhall be taken to be ſuch wherupon proclamation is made, untill the contrary ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeareth to the Court.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon why a <hi>Quid juris clamat</hi> is at this day maintained upon ſuch a Fine, which was not at Common Law before this Statute, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will never lye. And ſo it was holden lately in the Common Bench, in the caſe of Iuſtice <hi>Wimondham,</hi> and yet we may ſee that the <hi>Quid juris clamat</hi> ought to be brought before that the Fine be engroſſed, wherby it is manifeſt that now a Fee-ſimple ſhall paſſe by the Fine levied, for the poſſibility of the Proclamations, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the Proclamations ſhall not be made, and to this Fee-ſimple the Proclamations ſhall enure to make a bar to the Eſtate-tail: But ſuch a Fine by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Gawdy</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong to him who had the Reverſion or Remainder in Fee being levied by him who had a mean Reverſion or Remainder in Tail, depending upon an Eſtate for life, or in Tail precedent.</p>
               <p>And it is cleer, that the Proclamations do not make the Eſtate, but enure to the Eſtate made by the Fine, for if an Eſtate be granted in Reverſion for life, or in Tail by Fine, with Proclamations by ſuch a Tenant in Tail, in Reverſion or Remainder, the Proclamations work to this Eſtate, and no further, for alwaies the Eſtate paſſe by the Fine, and the Proclamations make the Bar according to the Eſtate, which paſſe by the Fine before.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Clench, Gawdy,</hi> and <hi>Fennor,</hi> the Fee-ſimple which was in the Queen after the Fine levied as before, was diveſted by means of this claim made upon the poſſeſſion of the Queen, lo that the Proclamations following are of no force to hurt the Eſtate tail, for they ſaid, in divers caſes a poſſeſſion may be inveſted out of the Queen without Office, Petition, or <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> as the caſe is, where a man deviſe that his Land ſhall be ſold, and in the mean time before the ſale, the poſſeſſion of the Land cometh to the Queen, and afterwards the Land is ſold according to the Will, the Vendee enter, there the Land paſſe from the Queen therby, and is diveſted, and ſo in many other caſes. And in all caſes where the Queens Eſtate is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the Subject may enter into the Land without Office, or <hi>Ouſter le main, &amp;c.</hi> And they ſaid, if it had been in the poſſeſſion of a common perſon, that by ſuch a claim the force of the Fine had been defeated; and this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the caſe between <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> in the <hi>Commentaries,</hi> where it is holden that where a Fine is levied with Proclamations by Tenant in Tail of an Advowſon, Rent, or Tithes, by claim made by the Iſſue in Tail, before the Proclamations are paſſed, where the Tenant in Tail is dead, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53226:37"/>
ſame is defeated, and that the Proclamations paſſing afterwards, ſhall not be of force to bar the Intail.</p>
               <p>And they ſaid, that the conveyance therof to the Queen after the Fine levied, doth not make it to be in worſe caſe; And admit it will not ſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen, yet the claim will ſerve againſt <hi>Bret,</hi> when he had entred by the performance of the Condition.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Clench</hi> and <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Bret</hi> ſhall not take advantage of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Deed made by himſelf, of very purpoſe to bar the party who had right, and to put him without remedy, no more then where the Diſſeiſor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoff his Father who dies ſeiſed, he ſhall not take advantage of this deſcent, or if he who hath cauſe of Action to recover Lands by Covin, cauſeth another to enter into the Lands, to the intent to recover againſt him, and does it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly for the Covin, the Recovery ſhall be avoided, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner here.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Popham</hi> took a diverſity, where the Poſſeſſion or the Eſtate of the Queen is determined, and where not, for where the Eſtate is determined, there the Subject may enter into the Land without Office, or <hi>ouſter le main:</hi> But where the Poſſeſſion continues, there the party ſhall not come to it, unleſſe by petition, <hi>Monſtrans de droit officio,</hi> or the like, and therfore hee ſaid, that if the Queen had an Eſtate <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> or depending upon any other Limitation, if it be determined according to the Limitation, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who hath intereſt may enter; ſo in the caſe of the Deviſe put before.</p>
               <p>And if a Leaſe be made for life, the Remainder in Tail, the Reverſion in Fee, and he in the Remainder in Tail levy a Fine, <hi>Sur conuſance de droit come ceo que il ad de ſon done</hi> to a ſtranger, with proclamations according to the Statute, and afterwards the ſtranger convey the Remainder to the Queen, her Heirs and Succeſſors, and after the Tenant for life dies, and after he in the Remainder in tail dies without Iſſue, now may he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in Fee enter, becauſe the Eſtate of the Queen is determined: But here the Queen hath a Fee-ſimple in her ſelf but determinable upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-tail which yet remaineth, which Fee-ſimple in Reverſion cannot be diveſted out of the poſſeſſion of the Queen but by matter of Record, of ſo high nature as it is in her, <hi>to wit,</hi> by Petition, <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> or the like: As if a Reverſſon or Remainder be alienated in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> the claim of the Lord ſufficeth ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to veſt the Reverſion in the Lord for the Alienation, but if the Reverſion or Remainder of which ſuch a claim was made be conveyed to the King, his remedy is now by Office, <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> or Petition, for claim will not now ſerve him, for this ſhall be to diveſt the poſſeſſion out of the Queen, which by ſuch means cannot be done no more then where a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or Remainder is granted to the Queen upon Condition, but he ought to have an Office to find the performance of it, if it be to be performed by matter in <hi>pais,</hi> and without <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> or otherwiſe it ſhall not be diveſted out of the Queens poſſeſſion, yet in the caſe of a common perſon, a claim will diveſt it out of them, but not ſo of the Queen.</p>
               <p>And theſe caſes <hi>Gawdy</hi> agreed; but he conceived that in the caſe in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the claim made determines the Eſtate of the Queen, which is made by means of the Fine upon the Statute.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Popham</hi> denied the caſe put in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. to be Law, as it is put upon the opinion of <hi>Strange</hi> there, for it is cleer, that the claim there does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt any poſſeſſion which was in the King by means of the Wardſhip, and if this be not therby defeated, the claim does not help the Diſſeiſee againſt the Deſcent; and this appeareth fully by <hi>Littleton,</hi> who ſaith ſo of a Claime which avoids a Deſcent, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it ought to be ſuch upon which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee may upon every ſuch Claim made have an Action of Treſpaſſe or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe againſt the Diſſeſſor, or him who is in poſſeſſion, if he continue his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion after ſuch Claim made, which cannot be in this caſe where the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53226:37"/>
is in the King, which cannot be defeated by ſuch a Claim. And in the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> where the Feoffee, or Mortgagee of Lands holden of the Queen in <hi>Capite</hi> by Knights Service, died before the day of Redemption, his Heir being within age, wherby upon Office found, the Queen had the Wardſhip of the body and land of the Heir, after which the Mortgagee at the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption made payment, and of this alſo an Office was found, yet he could not enter either before or after Office, but upon <hi>Monſtrans de droit</hi> therupon he had his <hi>Ouſter le main:</hi> And the reaſon why a Claim ſhall ſerve in this caſe between common perſons, is, becauſe that by ſuch Claim the thing it ſelf is deveſted out of him who had it before, and therby actually veſted in him who made the claim: As where a Villain purchaſe a Reverſion by the Claim of the Lord, the Reverſion is actually in him, as it is of a Poſſeſſion by Entry: But where he is put to his Claim to deveſt any thing out of a common perſon, he is put to his Suit to deveſt it out of the Queen.</p>
               <p>Aad to ſay, that <hi>Bret</hi> ſhould not take advantage of this Conveyance made, to make it good by the Fine.</p>
               <p>I think the Law to be clear otherwiſe as to this point, for the Statute of Fines was made tor the ſecurity of Purchaſors and Poſſeſſors of Land, and therfore taken more ſtrongly againſt them who pretend Right or Title, and for the greateſt advantage that may be for the Poſſeſſors of Lands, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poſſeſſor by what ever means he can, may make his Fine to be force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? And therfore the Fine upon this Statute differeth much from a Fine at Common Law; for where at Common Law an Infent being a Diſſeiſor was diſſeiſed by one who levies a Fine, and the year and the day paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out claim of the firſt Diſſeiſee, now was the firſt Diſſeiſee barred: yet if afterwards the Infant (who was not bound by the Fine) enter, the firſt Diſſeiſee may enter upon him, becauſe that by this entry the Fine at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law was utterly defeated.</p>
               <p>But now by the Statute, ſuch a Fine being levied with Proclamations, the firſt Diſſeiſee not purſuing according to the Statute, is barred for ever.</p>
               <p>And although the Infant enter at full age, and undoes the Fine as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet this Fine remains alwaies to bar the firſt Diſſeiſſee, and makes that the Infant hath now Right againſt all the world, and ſo now takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage therof: And this is the intent of the Statute for the repoſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Suits, and the quiet of the people.</p>
               <p>And if I procure a Fine to be levied on purpoſe to bar another of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he may have againſt me for the Land, yet I ſhall take advantage of this Fine, and the other ſhall have no advantage againſt me, becauſe of this Covin, for if this ſhould be admitted, it will countervail the benefit which is intended to be by means of the Statute of Fines.</p>
               <p>And if a Diſſeiſor enfeoffee another upon Condition, to the intent that a Fine with Proclamations ſhall be levied to the Feoffee to bar the Diſſeiſee, and after the Diſſeiſee is barred, the Diſſeiſor enter for the Condition, he ſhall yet take advantage of the Fine againſt the Diſſeiſee.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Popham</hi> put a caſe which was in this Court, 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon a ſpeciall Verdict which was between <hi>Okes</hi> Plaintiff, upon the Demiſe of <hi>John</hi> late Lord <hi>Sturton of Cottington</hi> which was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> Sturton <hi>was Tenant for life of certain Lands in</hi> Lighe <hi>in the County of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>the remainder in Tail to</hi> Charles <hi>late Lord</hi> Sturton, <hi>Father to the ſaid</hi> Iohn <hi>Lord</hi> Sturton; <hi>and the ſaid</hi> Charles <hi>Lord</hi> Sturton, <hi>diſſeiſed the ſaid Lady</hi> Sturton, <hi>and levied a Fine of the ſaid Land to</hi> Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington <hi>and his Heirs, with Proclamations according to the Statute, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted it againſt him, and his Heirs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53226:38"/>
And the ſaid Lord <hi>Charles</hi> dyed before the Proclamations paſt, and the Warranty deſcended upon the ſaid <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> after which, and before the Proclamations paſt, the ſaid Lady <hi>Sturton</hi> entred upon the ſaid <hi>Cottington,</hi> after which the ſaid Lady died, and after her death and all the Proclamations paſt, the ſaid <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> as Heir in Tail entred, and made the Leaſe to the ſaid <hi>Okes,</hi> upon whom <hi>Cottington</hi> the Defendant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as under the right of the ſaid <hi>Cottington</hi> the Conuſee. And I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Court ſtrongly to incline upon the matter of Warranty, that it ſhall bar the entry of the Heir, and make a diſcontinuance againſt him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inference which is taken by <hi>Littleton</hi> in his Chapter of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance,</hi> becauſe the truth was, and ſo acknowledged to the Court (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were omitted in the Verdict) that the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> was attained of Felony and Murther, and ſo the blood corrupted between the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> wherby in a new Action the <hi>Garran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> had not hurt the Title of the ſaid Lord <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then moved the Court upon the other point of the Fine with Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the Court alſo agreed in this point, if the Warranty had not been, that yet the Fine with Proclamations ſhall bar the ſaid <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> notwithſtanding the entry made by the Lady <hi>Sturton</hi> were before the Proclamations paſt, becauſe that notwithſtanding his regreſſe made, the Reverſion remains in <hi>Cottington</hi> not defeated by his regreſſe, in reſpect of the Statute whch makes that the Fine remains effectuall againſt the Heir in Tail, if nothing be done by him to undo it before the Proclamations paſt as by claim, regreſſe, and the like; but the Act of a ſtranger ſhall not help him, wherby Iudgment being therupon given againſt the ſaid <hi>Okes,</hi> the ſaid <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> ſtood ſatiſfied, and the <hi>Cottingtons</hi> enjoy the Land to this day; wheras, if this opinion of the Court had not been on a new Action, the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> might have been relieved againſt the Warranty.</p>

               <p>And for difficulty of the caſe it was adjourned into the Exchequer Chamber before all the Iuſtices and Barons of the Exchequer; And there it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by all, that a Warranty deſcending upon an Infant ſhall not bind him, in caſe that the entry of the Infant be lawfull into the Land, to which the Warranty is united: But the Infant ought in ſuch a caſe to look well that he do not ſuffer a deſcent of the Land after his full age, before he hath made his re-entry for then the Warranty, when he is to have an Action for the Land, ſhall bind him.</p>
               <p>And they agreed alſo that a Copyhold granted by a Diſſeiſor, or any other who hath the Mannor of which it is parcel by wrong, ſhall be avoided by the Diſſeiſee, or any other who hath right to the Mannor by his entry or recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Mannor.</p>
               <p>And ſo by <hi>Popham</hi> it was agreed by the Iuſtices in the caſe of the Manner of <hi>Haſſelbury Brian,</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> between <hi>Henry</hi> late Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> late Earl of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> but then he ſaid, that it was agreed, that admittance upon ſurrenders of Copyholders in Fee, to the uſe of another, or if an Heir in caſe of a Deſcent of a Copyhold were good, being made by a Diſſeiſor of a Mannor, or any other who hath it by Tort, becauſe theſe are acts of neceſſity, and for the benefit of a ſtranger, <hi>to wit,</hi> of him who is to have the Land by the ſurrender, or of the Heir: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Grants made by Copy by the Feoffee, upon condition of a Mannor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Condition broken, are good, becauſe he was lawfull <hi>Dominus pro tempore.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this was the Common Law before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Then the Letter of the Statute is not to execute any Vſe before that it hapneth to be an Vſe in <hi>Eſſe;</hi> for the words are, <hi>Where any perſon is ſeiſed to the uſe of any other perſon,</hi> that in ſuch a caſe, he who hath the Vſe ſhall have the ſame Eſtate in the Land which he had before in the Vſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the very letter of the Law he ought to have an Eſtate in the Vſe, and there ought to be a perſon to have the Vſe before the Statute intends to execute any poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Vſe, for the words are expreſſe, that in every ſuch caſe he ſhall have it, therfore not another: And therfore the Statute had purpoſe to execute the Vſes in poſſeſſion, Reverſion, or Remainder, preſently upon the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made to the Vſes: But for the future Vſes which were to be raiſed at a time to come upon any contingent, as to the Infants here, not being then born, the Statute never intended to execute ſuch Vſes untill they happen to have their beeing, and in the mean time to leave them as they were at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, without medling with, or altering of them in any manner untill this time, and if before this time, the root out of which theſe contingent Vſes ought to ſpring be defeated, the Vſe for this is utterly deſtroyed, and ſhall never afterwards have his being: as here by the Feoffment made by the ſaid Sir <hi>John Saintleger</hi> and his Co-feoffees, who then were but as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements <hi>pur auter vie, to wit,</hi> for the life of <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and which was a forfeiture of their Eſtate, and for which <hi>Oliver Chudleigh</hi> might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, it being before that the ſaid <hi>Strechley</hi> or <hi>John Chudleigh</hi> were born, the privity of them from Eſtate. being the root out of which this future uſe ought to have riſen is gone and deſtroyed, and therfore the Contingent Vſes utterly therby overthrown.</p>
               <p>As if before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Tenant for life had been, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over in Fee to an Vſe: If the Tenant for life had made a Feoffment in Fee, and he in the Remainder had releaſed to the Feoffee, the Vſe had been gone for ever, ſo in all theſe caſes of contingent Vſes at this day, for he who cometh to the poſſeſſion of Land by Diſſeiſin, or wrong done to the Poſſeſſor, who is ſeiſed to anothers uſe, ſhall never be ſeiſed to anothers uſe.</p>
               <p>And the caſe being ſo, that it is out of the letter of the Statute to execute ſuch contingent Vſes, it is more ſtrong for them out of the meaning of the Statute to execute, then before they happen to be in <hi>Eſſe:</hi> for this ſhall be to make all miſchiefs comprehended in the Preamble of this Statute, and againſt which the Statute intended to provide ſufficient remedy in a worſe miſchief then they were before the making of the ſame Statute, and this ſhall be but a perverſe inſtruction of the Statute.</p>
               <p>And they ſaid, that the ſubtleties uſed from time to time by means of thoſe Vſes, to the great deceit and trouble of the people, were the cauſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Statute, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and by all the Statutes formerly made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vſes, it appeareth that they were all taken to be grounded upon fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and crafty deviſes, and therfore this Law had no great purpoſe to favour them, but a <hi>Fortiorari,</hi> not to make them in worſe caſe by means of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute then they were before, and therfore it ſhall not be taken that the Vſe is executed by the Statute, which ſtands upon a contingency, of which a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſchief will enſue, then there was in ſuch a caſe before the Statute, and therfore by the Feoffment made in the interim, before the birth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53226:41"/>
which otherwiſe ought to have preſerved the Vſe, this Vſe was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed; and although the Feoffee of <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> had notice of the Vſe, yet this doth not now help in the caſe, becauſe the Feoffment did wrong to the Eſtate firſt ſetled, which was ſubject to the Vſe, and extinct in the ſame poſſibility which had been otherwiſe in the Feoffees to have given livelyhood to the ſaid Contingent Vſe: And therfore the Iudgment by them ought to be, that the Plaintiff ſhall be barred.</p>
               <p>Walmeſley, <hi>That the great miſchief which was at Common Law upon theſe Feoffments to Uſes, was, that none could know upon the occupation of the Land, who was true Owner of the Land, for</hi> Ceſtay que Vſe <hi>was the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>of the Profits, but in whom the Freehold or Inheritance of the Land was, there were not many which knew, wherby great miſchief came to the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which men had of Land which they purchaſed, and by it men knew not againſt whom to bring their Actions to recover their Rights, and by it Wives loſt their Dowers, Husbands their Tenancy by the Curteſie, Lords their Eſcheats, Wardſhips, and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this miſchief hapned by reaſon that one had the profit, and another the eſtate of the Land: And the Statute was made to put the Land and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate quite out of the Feoffee, who before did not meddle with the Land to <hi>Ceſtay que Uſe,</hi> who before had but the occupation and profits of the Land, and to this intent the letter of the Law ſerves very well, which ſayes that the Eſtate of the Feoffee ſhall be cleerly in <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe,</hi> and therfore nothing by the intent and letter of the Law is now to remain in the Feoffee, no more then a <hi>Scintilla juris nemor'd in Brents</hi> Caſe in my Lord Dyer. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the whole Eſtate in the interim untill the contingent happen ſhall be in them who have their Vſes in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and when the Contingent happen, the Statute gives place to this Contingent Vſe, and by the execution therof comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eſtates before executed, and as out of theſe by the Statute, but nothing is now after the Statute in the Feoffees, for the purpoſe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, was (as I have ſaid) to take away all from the Feoffee, for all was deveſted from him, becauſe that betwixt the Feoffor, &amp; the Feoffee was all the fraud before the Statute, and the very letter of the Statute is to extinguiſh and extirpate the aſſurances fraudulently made, which was alwaies by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of aſſurances made between the Eſtate of the Land in one, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion therof in another, and to cauſe that now that the Eſtate ſhall be to the uſe, where the occupation was before: And this Statute was not made to extinguiſh or diſcredit Vſes, but to advance them, as by bringing the very Eſtate in poſſeſſion to the Vſe, and by it the truſt now taken from all others who were truſted with it before, ſo the Statute doth not condemn the uſes, but the fraud which was by reaſon of them before. And the Statute being, that the Eſtate, Right, and Title of the Feoffees ſhall go to the uſes, therfore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaineth in the Feoffees, but all by authority of Parliament adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be in <hi>Ceſtay que uſe,</hi> which is the higheſt Iudgment that can be given in any Court, and the words <hi>(Stand and be ſeiſed at any time)</hi> refer as well to the future, as preſent uſes, and the Statute intended as well to help the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which ſhall be upon any Contingent, as thoſe which are at preſent, for a future or contingent Vſe is to be ſaid an Vſe, according to its nature or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and it ſhall be executed according to its quality when it happen. And the words are, that the Eſtate which was in the Feoffee ſhall be in <hi>Ceſtay que uſe</hi> and not the Eſtate which is, and therfore when the uſe hapneth to be in an inſtant, the Eſtate which at the firſt Livery was in the Feoffee, to this uſe ſhall now be executed in poſſeſſion to this contingent uſe, albeit it ſelf was altogether executed (as I ſaid before) in the Vſes which were in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and if ſo, it followeth that nothing which is done in the mean time by the Feoffee or can be done by any other, can prejudice or hurt the execution of this Vſe in contingency when the contingency happen.</p>

And for the caſe of Brook, 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is plain in paint, which is this.</p>

                  <hi>A Covenant with</hi> B. <hi>that if</hi> B. <hi>enfeoff him of three acres of Land in</hi> D. <hi>that then the ſaid</hi> A. <hi>and his Heirs, and all others ſeiſed of ſuch Lands ſhall ſtand therof ſeiſed to the uſe of the ſaid</hi> B. <hi>and his Heirs, after which</hi> A, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed a ſtranger of this Land, after which</hi> B. <hi>enfeoffed the ſaid</hi> A: <hi>of the ſaid three acres, now the uſe ſhall be to the ſaid</hi> B. <hi>and his Heirs of the ſaid other Land, for the Statute ſo binds the Land to this Contingency when it happens, that by no means it can be defeated, and this is the cauſe that Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made by force of Proviſoes compriſed in aſſurances are good, and cannot be avoided, for the Intereſts to theſe Leaſes is wrought by the firſt Livery and the Statute, atd therfore upon the matter, I conceive, that Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gawdy conceived that it is executed by the intent, but not by the letter of the Statute, for the purpoſe was to remove all the Eſtate from the Feoffee, and to put it in <hi>Ceſtay que uſe</hi> wholly, <hi>to wit,</hi> in poſſeſſions, to the Vſes which were in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and in aleyance as to the Vſes which were to come and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent; and now by the ſame Statute the contingency of the poſſeſſion ſhal go in licence of the contingent Vſe, and now an Vſe limited to one for life, with Remainder over to the Heirs of the body of <hi>I.

               <p>But he ſaid, <hi>That by the Feoffment made to</hi> Chriſtopher, <hi>the Contingent remainder which was deveſted in</hi> Stretchly <hi>and</hi> Iohn Chudleigh <hi>depending upon the Eſtate which Sir</hi> Iohn Saintleger <hi>and his Co-feoffees had for the life of</hi> Chriſtopher, <hi>is utterly gone and deſtroyed in the ſame manner, as where a Leaſe is made for life, the remainder to the right Heirs of</hi> I.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as in this caſe without a particular Eſtate of Free-hold, a Remainder cannot be, no more in the caſe now in queſtion being now become by means of the Statute, as if it had been an Eſtate executed in poſſeſſion; and for this cauſe only he conceived, that Judgment ought to be given againſt the Plaintiff.</hi>

                  <hi>It hath been agreed by all, that the Statute doth not execute any Uſe which was ſuſpended at the time of the making of the Statute, as by reaſon of a Diſſeiſor, or the like hapning before; and if it doth not execute the Uſe which is in ſuſpence for the right which he had in the Uſe, how can it execute the Uſe which hath not any being? for in ſuch caſes, of Infants not born as here, untill they be in</hi> Rerum natura, <hi>the Uſe cannot have any being.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Statute did not intend to deſtroy any Uſe, but to bring it back to the Poſſeſſion, according to the courſe of the common Law, and to avoid the fraud.</hi>

And therfore he put the caſe of</hi> Cramner, <hi>who made a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf for his life, and after his deceaſe to the uſe of his Executors for years, this Eſtate for years is not now veſted in any, becauſe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have an Executor during his life, and yet it remains as in the cuſtody of the Law, untill there are Executors to take it.</hi>

               <p>Anderſon, <hi>That an Uſe was not at Common Law, for the Common Law had no reſpect to it, but to the Feoffee, and it was the perſon who by the Law had any thing to do in the Land, and not</hi> Ceſtay que Vſe, <hi>for he might puniſh</hi> Ceſtay que Vſe <hi>for his medling with the Land, and</hi> Ceſtay que Vſe <hi>had no remedy againſt him by no means; But by</hi> Suboepna <hi>in the Court of Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, an Vſe being limited to another in Fee, no Vſe can be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited further therupon for any Eſtate. And it hath been well ſayd, that the letter of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. did not tend to execute this Vſe which was not in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and for the intent therof, that it did not tend to execute any contingent Vſe untill that it happen, which is proved by the caſe, that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for years being aſſigned over, or granted to an Vſe, the Vſe of this is not executed by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as it was agreed about 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and what was the reaſon in the caſe, but becauſe there was not any Seiſin in the Vſe, but only a poſſeſſion to the Vſe? wherby the words of the Statute are much to be regarded. And here how can there be a Seiſſin to the Vſe which is not? it cannot be, and therfore for the like reaſon, as in the other caſe it is never executed, nor ſhall be removed by means of ſuch an Vſe, untill it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be an Vſe in <hi>Eſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for <hi>Brents</hi> Caſe, I have alwaies taken the better opinion to be, that the Wife cannot take in the caſe for the mean diſturbance, notwithſtanding the Iudgment which is entred therupon, which was by aſſent of the parties and given only upon a default made after an Adjournment upon the Demurrer, for he ſaid, that he had viewed the Roll therof on purpoſe; and if it be, that ſuch a Contingent Vſe be not executed untill it hapneth to be in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> here it appeareth, that by the Feoffment <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> is in, of another Eſtate which was not ſubject to the Vſe, becauſe he is in by forfeiture and wrong made to this Eſtate, and therfore not bound to the Vſe in Contingency, although he made it without conſideration, and although he had notice of this contingent Vſe, and therfore this contingent Vſe utterly defeated before it had any being.</p>
               <p>But in all the Caſes put on the other ſide, it doth not appear that there was any thing done in diſturbance of theſe mediate uſes before they hapned, and therfore not to be compared to this caſe, wherby he conceived that the Plaintiff ought to be barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, <hi>That in as much as the manner of aſſurance made by Sir</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Chudleigh <hi>may ſeem ſtrange, and in ſome manner to touch the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſaid Sir</hi> Richard <hi>(who was a grave and honeſt Gentleman) to thoſe who heare it, and do not know the reaſon why he did it, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to be this as I have heard,</hi> to wit, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one</hi> Buller <hi>a Gentleman of good reputation, wherupon he fled into</hi> France, <hi>and the ſaid Sir</hi> Richard <hi>doubting what would become of his Eſtate; if he ſhould dye before he had ſetled his Land, and yet having a deſire to have power to undo the aſſurance which he purpoſed to make, if he pleaſed, his Councell then thought the beſt way to make and deviſe the aſſurance, ſo, that ſuch an Eſtate of Inheritance might therby be in him which could not deſcend to the ſaid</hi> Chriſtopher, <hi>and yet ſuch, that he might therby undo the aſſurance made by the Recovery when he pleaſed, and yet ſuch alſo as ſhould never take effect in any of the Iſſues of his other Wives, to the prejudice of his right Wives, becauſe he never had a purpoſe to marry with any of theſe Wives.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:53226:43"/>
And to that which hath been touched by <hi>Periam, That this Limitation firſt made is a Fee-ſimple in Sir Richard,</hi> I conceive cleerly the contrary, For if it ſhould be ſo, then no Vſe could be limited over upon this Fee-ſimple, as hath been ſaid before, and therfore all the remainder of the Caſe had been to no end; but he ſaid, that it was an Eſtate-tail ſpeciall in Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and denied the opinion of <hi>Ay ſcough</hi> taken ſo in 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and this by reaſon of the Statute of <hi>Donis conditionalibus,</hi> which wills <hi>Quod voluntas donatoris ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum formam doni in charta doni manifeſte expreſſam de caetero obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> And here it is expreſſe, that the Heirs of Sir <hi>Richard</hi> begotten upon any of the ſaid Wives ſhall have the Land, and therby it ſhall be underſtood that his Heirs ſhall be intended by common intendment the Heirs by him. To which opinion <hi>Anderſon</hi> agreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the matter,</hi> Popham <hi>conceived cleerly that there was not any ſuch uſe at Common Law as we commonly call an uſe, and yet he acknowledged there were alwaies truſts at Common Law; but every truſt is not to be ſaid an uſe: for none will doubt but that a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reaſons which are alledged in</hi> 27. H. 8. <hi>and in the caſe vouched</hi> 24. H. 8. <hi>that a truſt was at Common Law is, by the one of them the</hi> Cauſa Matrimonii prolocuti, <hi>which (as they pretend) ought to prove that there was a truſt at Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the other the Statute of Marlbridge, that the Lord in caſe of Wards againſt Feoffments made by Colluſion, which Feoffments (they alledge) prove that a truſt then was.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To which it was ſaid, that the gift made by a woman to another, to the intent that he ſhal marry her, hath in it a Condition more properly implied, to wit, that if he doe not marry her, that ſhe ſhall have her land back againe, for which the Common Law gives her remedy by the Action aforeſaid, for if it had been but a truſt, no remedy had been by the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the Statute of</hi> Marlbridge <hi>the contrary therunto is manifeſtly proved, for the Statute ſpeaks but of Feoffments made to Heirs apparants or upon Condition, or to the intent to enffeoff the Heir at his full age, or the like, in which caſes the uſe alwayes goes with the Poſſeſſions, and is not to the Feffor: And the Statute of</hi> 4. H. 7. <hi>was made in vaine, which gives the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of</hi> Ceſtuy que <hi>uſe where no Will is declared, which had not been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if Feoffments within the Statute of</hi> Marlbridge <hi>had been ſaid to have been to Uſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And without doubt if thoſe who made the Statute of Marlbridge had then had knowledge of theſe Feoffments to Uſes which were ſo miſchievous, and more then the other Feoffments by Colluſion, they then would have provided remedy for theſe caſes of Uſes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo the Statute de Religioſis ordains that Nec arte, nec ingenio, Lands ſhal not be conveyed in Mortmain, and therby it was conceived that a full provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been made againſt theſe Mortmains, and yet in</hi> 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Proviſion was made againſt Uſes conveyed in Mortmain to Religious or other Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which they took the Profits.</hi>

And without doubt thoſe who were ſo preciſe in the making of the Statute of <hi>Religioſis</hi> againſt <hi>Mortmains,</hi> would alſo have made proviſion for the uſes if they had then been known.</p>
               <p>But to cleer this point, without all controverſie the Statute it ſelf of uſes, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. makes it plain, which ſaith expreſly that by the Common Law of the Realm, Lands or Tenements ought not to paſſe from one to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſolemn Livery, matter of Record, or writing, and that theſe Feoffments to uſes were Errors uſed and accuſtomed within the Realm, to the Subverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ancient Laws; therfore it ſtands not with the ancient Common Law of the Realm, as all the Parliment took it, which is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded then any Book vouched. But ſee how, and when they began and crept in at Common Law, and it ſhall be eaſily perceived (as it hath been well ſaid by ſome of thoſe who argued to this point at the beginning) that they began by two means, <hi>to wit,</hi> by fraud, and by fear. And he ſaid, that the firſt Book which he had ſeen in all the Books of the Law, which tend to an uſe, is the caſe of 8. <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> which makes mention that the Counſee of a Fine entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land in the right of another, which is to be taken to anothers uſe. And in the <hi>Quadrageſſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. mention is made of the Feoffees of the Lord <hi>Burglaſh,</hi> who ſued to the King by petition, and by the Statute of 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. mention is made that divers gave their Lands to their Friends to have the profits. and afterwards fled to priviledged places, and lived there to the hinderance of their Creditors; And therfore it was provided that in ſuch a caſe execution ſhall be made, as if no ſuch aſſurance had been made. And by 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. theſe are called Feoffments to uſes, and made by craft to deceive Creditors, and there is the firſt mention which is made in any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the word <hi>(Uſe:)</hi> So fraud hath been alwaies the chief foundation of theſe Vſes; yet in time they began to have ſome credit in the Law. And this was when men ſaw that the Court of <hi>Conſcience</hi> gave remedy in theſe caſes againſt ſuch who had not the conſcience themſelves to perform the truſt put in them, and to take away the danger which hapned to an infinite number of good Subjects, upon the <hi>Garboyls</hi> which hapned between the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. and that of King <hi>H.</hi> 7. cauſed that in effect, all the Poſſeſſions of the Realm were put in Feoffments to uſes. And the firſt caſe in the Law which ſpeaks of this word <hi>(Uſe)</hi> which he ever ſaw was (as he ſaid) in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. And in the like caſe by <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. no remedy is given by the Law for <hi>Ceſtay que uſe,</hi> and afterwards it crept into the Law as appeareth, yet as an Error of long time uſed: And if before the Statute of 27 <hi>H</hi> 8. a Leaſe had been made for life, the remainder in Fee, to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the uſe of the firſt Son of the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> and ſo further as here:</p>

                  <hi>If the Tenant for life had made a Feoffment in Fee to a ſtranger, and had not given the ſtranger notice of the Uſe, and all this were without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and afterwards he in the Remainder in Fee to the Uſe had releaſed all his Right to the ſaid ſtranger, every one of them had been hereby without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for their Uſes:</hi> Were the Son of <hi>B.</hi> born before or after this wrong done: So if it were at Common Law before this Statute as hath been we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l ſaid, and the Law being ſo before this Statute, then he ſaid it was to be ſeen what was to be done in the caſe after the Statute, which will ſtand altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this, what will become of theſe contingent Vſes to the Sons not born at the time of the ſaid Feoffment made by Sir <hi>John Saintleger</hi> and his Co-feoffees, by this Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and it ſeems to him cleerly that no poſſeſſion is executed to any contingent uſe by this Statute, untill it comes in being; and that as the caſe is here and in ſome other ſpeciall caſes it ſhall never be executed: And one cauſe why ſuch a contingent Vſe ſhall not be executed, is, becauſe it doth not ſtand with the letter of the Law, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is againſt the letter.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe is, becauſe it is utterly againſt the intent of the Law to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53226:44"/>
execute it, as the caſe is here. It doth not ſtand with the Letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for this is, <hi>Where any perſon or perſons ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of any other perſon or perſons,</hi> &amp;c. And it is cleer that none can ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of him who is not, neither can he who is not in <hi>rerum natura</hi> have any uſe; therfore the caſe here doth not ſtand with the letter of the Statute to be now executed,</p>
               <p>And further, the words following are, <hi>that in every ſuch caſe, every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who hath ſuch an Uſe in Fee-ſimples, Fee-tail. for life, for years,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in Remainder or Reverſion ſhall ſtand hereafter ſeiſed and adjudged in lawfull Eſtate and Poſſeſſions of the Lands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of ſuch an Eſtate as he had in the Uſe:</hi> The words then in the Statute being ſo preciſe as they ſtand, <hi>to wit,</hi> that in ſuch caſe he who hath ſuch an Vſe ſhall have the poſſeſſion execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſuch an Eſtate as he had in the Vſe, excludes all other who are not in it, to have it to be executed untill that they happen to be in the ſame caſe as of that which the Statute ſpeaks, And if they had intended to have the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to be executed and tranſferd from the Feoffees to theſe contingent V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they would have made ſome mention therof as well as they did of Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Remainders, and they did not leave there, but mention this again, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the Eſtate, Right, Title, and Poſſeſſions which was in ſuch perſon or perſons which were ſeiſed to the uſe of any ſuch perſon or perſons, ſhall be hereafter cleerly adjudged in him, or thoſe who had or have ſuch Vſe according to ſuch quality, manner, form, and condition as he had before the uſe which was in them, by which it appeareth plainly, that the Right and Poſſeſſion of the Feoffee ſhall not be veſted in or to any, untill that he hath the uſe it ſelf; for it is ſaid, that it ſhall be in him, therfore they ought to have ſomthing in the Vſe by the very expreſſe letter of the Statute, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the Poſſeſſion ſhall be executed or transferred by this Statute from the Feoffee to <hi>Ceſtay que uſe:</hi> And how can this be ſaid to be within the letter of the Statute, which hath ſo many and ſo preciſe words and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches againſt it. And therfore it is cleer, that if the Feoffee to uſe were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the time of making of this Statute, that the uſe ſhall not be executed by this Statute, untill there be a regreſſe made by the Feoffee, or in his right to revive the former uſe, and it had been out of the letter of the Statute.</p>
               <p>But to this I ſay, that how preciſe ſoever the letter is againſt the execution of theſe contingent uſes, the intent therof is yet more ſtrong &amp; preciſe againſt them, which I will prove cleerly by the Statute it ſelf, which is of greater authority then the particular opinion or conceit of any Iudge whomſoever, for it is the Iudgment of all the Iudges, and all the Realm alſo which ought to bind all, and to which all ought to give credit. And to take the intent, the Statute was full that it was made (as is reherſed) for the Diſinheriſon which before was to true Heirs; for the defect which before was in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Purchaſes, for the miſchiefs, in regard before men did not know (by reaſon of theſe Vſes) againſt whom to bring their Actions to recover their Rights. To avoid perjury that it ſhould not be ſo common as it was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the maintenance and ſupport of theſe ſecret Vſes, for the releif of the King &amp; other Lords, as to their Eſcheats, Forfeitures, Wardſhips, Releaſes and the like, for the miſchief which before hapned to Tenants by the Curteſie, and in Dower, by reaſon of theſe Eſtates in Vſe; and finally for the great Incoveniencies which hapned by reaſon of them, to the great trouble and unquiet of the People: Theſe were the great miſchiefs that were before the making of the Statute, and theſe were the things for which the Statute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to provide remedy, and if the expoſition ſhall be as hath been on the other ſide, theſe miſchiefs ſhall be on every part more miſchievous by much, then it was before the making of the Statute, and that in ſuch a a manner, that it ſhall be impoſſible to help any of them but by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wheras alwaies the good and true conſtruction of a Statute is to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53226:45"/>
conſtrain it, ſo that it ſhall give remedy to the miſchief which was before, and not to make it more miſchievous, and therfore examine it by parts.</p>
               <p>And as to the diſinheriſon of two Heirs, it appears now that by ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition more incoveniences will ariſe, and that in a more dangerous degree then before the Statute; for before, for the Vſe the Heir had his remedy in conſcience according to the truſt, and he might have made a diſpoſition of the Land it ſelf, by the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. as an Owner, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Wife, and his Children, and for payment of his debts, and the like. But as the caſe is now uſed by means of theſe perpetuities (as they are called) if the expoſition of the other ſide ſhall hold place, the true Heir ſhall not only be continually in danger to looſe his Inheritance, but by them the very bowels of nature it ſelf ſhall come to be divided, and as rent in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for by reaſon of theſe the Inheritants themſelves cannot make any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proviſion for the advancement of their Wives, Daughters, or young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sons, as every one according to the courſe of nature ought to do, nor by reaſon of this can he redeem himſelf if he were taken Priſoner: And this will make diſobedience in Children to their Parents, when they ſee that they ſhall have their Patrimony againſt their will, wherby ſuch Children oftentimes become unnaturall and diſſoluts, of which I in my time have ſeen many unnaturall, dangerous, and fearfull conſequences, not convenient to be ſpoken of. And it ſtaies not there, but it cauſeth mortall debate (as to blood) between Coſin, and Coſin, Brother, and Brother, and not ſo only, but between the Father himſelf and his Children, of which every one of us have ſeen the experience, for the one ought to be as a watch upon the other, to ſee when any thing happen to be done, to give him advantage to diſinherit the very true Owner.</p>
               <p>And I ſay, that it is impoſſible that any can keep his Poſſeſſions which hath them tyed with theſe perpetuities, if the expoſition of the Statute ſhould hold place which the other ſide hath made. And I affirm preciſely, that there is not any one in <hi>England</hi> who hath had ſuch Poſſeſſions ſo bound by deſcent of Inheritance by five years of any value, but that he hath loſt all, or part of his ſaid Land at this time, let him be never ſo preciſe in making his Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and yet he is not ſure to have one skilfull in the Law alwaies at his elbow when he is to meddle with his Land. And therfore I put but this Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One who hath ſuch a perpetuity with power to make Leaſes, rendring the ancient Rent, or more, hath two Farms, either of them of the ancient Rent of</hi> 20 <hi>s. a year but the one is worth</hi> 60 <hi>l. a year, and the other but</hi> 20 <hi>l. theſe are in hand to be better together, rendring</hi> 53 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. for both together, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath loſt all, or part of his Land, according to that of which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity is; ſo it is evident that it will happen to be more miſchievous in time to come, and therfore by this expoſition much more to the diſinheriſon of the Heir, then it was before the making of this Statute. And which is more miſchievous if a Feme putein happen to be in ſuch a houſe who happen to have Children in Adultery, theſe Baſtards ſhall have the Land againſt the will of the Father, to the utter diſinheriſon of the true Heirs, and againſt the intent of him who made the limitation, by which we may ſee the juſt Judgment of of God upon theſe who attempt by humane pollicy, to circumvent the divine providence of God for the time to come; and of this alſo I have ſeen an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now to the miſchief, that men do not know againſt whom to bring their Actions to ſue for their Rights, and it is cleer, that now by ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they ſhall be now in much worſe condition then they were before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for before the Action was given againſt him who received the Profits, which is now gone by this Statute in the caſes of Free-hold, and therfore if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſition ſhall hold place, it is cleer that untill the Statute of</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53226:45"/>
                  <hi>men might have been by means of this Statute put out of all remedy to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their rights by any manner of Action, as ſome put it in practice, as to make Feoffments to the uſe of the Feoffor, and his Heirs, untill any intend to bring an Action againſt him for this Land, and then over to others upon the like lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And to that which hath been argued on the other ſide, and firſt to that which was ſaid by <hi>Walmſley, That the Right, Eſtate, and Poſſeſſion is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Feoffee, and veſted to the Vſes, which have their beeing by the Statute, and that upon the Contingents hapning, their Eſtates uncouple and give place to the contingent Vſe then executed, and that the execution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be by a Poſſeſſion d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>And I remember, that when I was a Counſellor at Law in the time of the Lord</hi> Dyer, <hi>where a Feoffment was made to the Vſe of one for life, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders over, with reſtraint to alien, and with power given to Tenant for life to make Leaſes for one and twenty years, or three lives, it was much doubted whether this power ſo limited to him without words in the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Feoffee and his Heirs ſhall ſtand ſeiſed to theſe Vſes, ſhall be good to make ſuch Leaſes, or not? And therfore ſuppoſe that a man bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and ſells Land to one for his life by Deed indented and inrolled, and make therin a</hi> Proviſo, <hi>that the Tenant for life may make ſuch Leaſes, this is to no purpoſe as to power to make a Leaſe, but the ſtrongeſt caſe which he put was, that of</hi> 30 H. 8. <hi>which I agreed to be Law, as it is there put, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were before or after the Statute of</hi> 27 H 8. <hi>for it is not there put that the Feoffment was made upon any conſideration to the ſtranger, in which caſe, although he had no notice of the firſt Covenant, yet in ſuch a caſe he ſhall take the Poſſeſſion ſubject to the Vſe, to which it was bound by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Covenant: But if you conſider the caſe well, you ſhall ſee that it was a caſe before the Statute, for it followeth preſently in the ſame caſe, that it is there ſaid, that it is not like the caſe where the Feoffees in Vſe fell the Land to one who hath no notice of the firſt Vſe, wherby it appeareth that it was a caſe before the Statute, for otherwiſe there had been no cauſe to have ſpoken then of the Feoffees to an Vſe, and by the ſame it appeareth, if the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had bargained and ſold the Land to another, the ſame Vſe had never riſen upon the Covenant, and therfore it is cleer againſt the Law, that the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be bound w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter of truſt to be hereafter repoſed in any Feoffee: this is well ſpoken, but not well proved; for as I have ſaid before, it is an expoſition quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the letter and intention of the Law. And I agree, as hath been ſaid, if there be none to take the Uſe at the time that it falleth to be in poſſeſſion, according to the limitation that he ſhall never take it afterwards, no more of an Uſe upon the Statute then of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

S. no more then if an Eſtate had been ſo made: But this makes for me,</hi> to wit, <hi>that the Eſtate upon the Uſes executed by the Statute, ſhall be of the ſame condition as Eſtates in poſſeſſion were at Common Law, and that they being executed ought alſo to be ſuch, of which the Common Law makes allowance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And by way of argument, I agree for the time that it is, as hath been ſaid by them who maintain that an Uſe may be in ſuſpence, as to that which is an Uſe in its proper nature, for it is not properly ſaid an Uſe, untill that it be ſaid in</hi> Eſſe, <hi>to take the Profits themſelves: But I am to turn this Argument againſt him who made it, for if it be ſo, the Uſe can never be in ſuſpence, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſo, it follows that no Poſſeſſion by means of any ſuch Uſe can be in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but ſtaies where it was before to be executed when the Uſe happens to be in beeing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as to that, that a Reverſion or Remainder may be of that which we call an Uſe, ſo alſo may ſuch a Uſe be in ſuſpence in the ſame manner as the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion it ſelf, but not otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Cramners</hi> Caſe formerly put, the Law is ſo, becauſe nothing appeareth in the caſe to be done, to the diſturbance of this contingent Vſe in the interim before it happen. But upon the Caſe put of the Lady <hi>Bray,</hi> upon which it hath been ſo ſtrongly relied, it was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord Bray made an aſſurance of certain Lands, to the uſe of certain of his Councell, untill the Son of the ſaid Lord Bray ſhould come to the age of</hi> 21. <hi>years, for the livelyhood of the ſaid Son, and of ſuch a Wife as he ſhall marry with the aſſent of the ſaid Councell, and then to the uſe of the ſaid Son and of the ſaid Wife, and of the Heirs of the body of the ſaid Son: The Father dies, the Son was become in Ward to the King, after which one of the ſaid Councellors dies, the King grants over the Wardſhip of the ſaid Son, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the ſaid Lord Bray by the aſſent of his Guardian, and of the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Councellors marries the Daughter of the then Earl of Shrewsbury, after which the Husband aliens the ſame Land to one Butler, and dies, and upon Action brought by the ſaid Lady againſt the ſaid Butler for the ſame land, ſhe was barred by Judgment, and upon what reaſon? becauſe ſhe was not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon known when the Statute was made, which muſt be in every caſe of a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Demeſne, as well in caſe of an Uſe, as in caſe of a Poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therfore a Leaſe for years, the Remainder to the Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> then living, is not good, and the ſame Law of an Vſe. And ſo it was agreed by all the Iuſtices very lately in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> but in theſe Caſes it remaineth to the Feoffor; and becauſe it doth not appear at the time of the aſſurance who ſhall be the Wife of the ſaid Son, ſo that there was not any to take the preſent Free-hold by name of the Wife of the Son, ſhe takes nothing by the aſſurance, but this reaſon makes for our ſide: to wit, <hi>That if there were none to take the Free-hold in</hi> Demeſne <hi>from the Uſe, when it falleth, he ſhall never take it,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other reaſon in this Caſe was, becauſe ſhe was not married by the conſent of all the Counſellors, for that one was dead, nor according to the power given by the agreement, but by the authority of the Guardian, that the power which the Father had upon his Son was ceaſed.</p>

                  <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, <hi>That they were not utterly againſt Uſes, but only againſt thoſe, and this part of them which will not ſtand with the publike Weal of of the Realm. and which being executed ſhall make ſuch an Eſtate which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with Common Law of the Realm, or the true purport of the Statute; and therfore he ſaid, that it was but to prune and cut off the rotten and corrupt branches of this Tree,</hi> to wit, <hi>that thoſe which had not their ſubſtance from the true Sap, nor from the ancient Law of the Realm, nor from the meaning of the Statute, and ſo to reduce the Tree to its beauty and perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon he ſaid, might have been made in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Arguments which were made to maintain the common Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to bar Eſtates-tail.

But the grave Iudges then ſaw what great trouble hapned amongſt the people by means of Intails, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity happened by means therof to true Purchaſors, for whoſe ſecurity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was before found (as we may ſee by our Books) but collaterall War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, or infinite delay by Voucher; and thus did the Iudges of this time look moſt deeply into it, wherupon, upon the very rules of Law it was found that by common Recovery with Vouchers theſe Eſtates-tail might be barred, which hath been great cauſe of much quiet in the Land untill this day, that now it begins to be ſo much troubled with the caſes of Vſes, for which it is alſo neceſſary to provide a lawfull remedy.</p>

               <p>But by the chief Iuſtices, chief Baron, and all the other Iuſtices and Barons, the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment in this caſe to recover the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, for the Law gives him at the beginning an Election to have it as a Rent or an Annuity, which matter of election ſhall not be taken from him, but by his own Deed and folly, as in caſe where he purchaſe part of the land charged, in which caſe by his own Act he hath excluded himſelf of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But if a Feoffee upon condition grant a Rent-charge, and preſently break the Condition, wherupon the Feoffor re-enter, ſhall not the Feoffee be charged by Writ of Annuity, ſurely it ſhall be, againſt all reaſon that he by his own act, without any folly of the Grantee, ſhall exclude the Grantee of his Election which the Law gives at the beginning.</p>
               <p>And they denied the opinion of 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. to be Law; But if the Diſſeiſor grant a Rent-charge to the Diſſeiſee out of the Land which he had by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53226:48"/>
Diſſeiſen by his re-entry, before the Annuity brought, the Annuity is gone; for this was his own act, yet in effect all of them agreed, that <hi>Prima facie,</hi> it ſhall be taken as a Rent-charge, of which the Wife ſhall be endowed, as hath been ſaid, which paſſe by grant of <hi>Omnia hereditamenta,</hi> and which is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the Land; but the reaſon is, becauſe it is expreſly granted out of the Land, and alſo for the preſumption of Law, that it is more beneficiall for the Grantee to have it in ſuch a degree, then in the other. But neither the preſumption of Law, nor the expreſſe Grant therof as a Rent, ſhall not take away from the Grantee the benefit of his Election, where no default was in him, but that upon his Election he may make it to be otherwiſe, as <hi>ab initio.</hi> And therfore by <hi>Popham, If a Rent-charge be granted in tail, the Grantee may bring a Writ of Annuity, and therby prejudice his Iſſue, becauſe that then it ſhall not be taken to be an Intail, but as a Fee-ſimple conditionall,</hi> ab initio. <hi>And if a Termer for two years grant a Rent-charge in fee, this as to the Land is but a Rent charge for two years, and if he avow for it upon the determination of the Term, the Rent is gone, but by way of Annuity it remains for ever, if it be granted for him and his Heirs, and aſſets deſcend from him who granted it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if a Rent-charge be granted in fee, and doth not ſay for him and his Heirs, if the Grantee brings his Writ of Annuity, the Heir ſhall never be charged therwith, yet if he had taken it as a Rent-charge, the Land had been charged with it in perpetuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And by him the cauſe why the Proviſo that he ſhall not charge the perſon of the Grantor upon the grant of a Rent-charge is good, is, becauſe the perſon is not expreſly charged by ſuch a Grant, but by operation of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in ſuch a caſe, a Proviſo that he ſhall not charge his Land is meerly void for the repugnancy, becauſe there the Land is expreſly charged by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed words, and therfore if it be expreſly compriſed in ſuch a Grant, that the Grantee may charge the Land, or the perſon of the Grantor, at his Election; provided then afterwards that he ſhall charge his perſon, is not good, Cauſa patet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all agreed, that upon a Rent granted upon equality of partition, or for allowance of Dower, or for recompence of a Title, an Annuity doth not lye, becauſe it is in ſatiſfaction of a thing reall, and therfore ſhall not fall to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſonall, but alwaies remains of the ſame nature as the thing for which it is given. And afterwards the ſame Term Iudgment was given in the Common Bench, that the Plaintiff ſhall recover, which is entred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And in the ſame caſe, <hi>Clark</hi> vouched that it was reported by <hi>Benloes</hi> in his Book of Reports; where a Rent was granted out of a Rectory by the Parſon who after wards reſigned the Parſonage, that it was agreed in the Common Pleas in his time, that yet a Writ of Annuity lies againſt the Grantor upon the ſame Grant, to which all, who agreed on this part, agreed that it was Law.</p>

               <p>And further, wheras the King made his Grant of the Hoſpitall, and of all the ſaid rent of Fagots and Focals, without making mention of 20 <hi>s.</hi> for the ſame, it was moved that if it doth paſſe to the King, yet it doth not paſſe from him to the Major, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in as much as he granted it preciſely as a Fuell, wheras it was in him as a Rent of Fuell, or of money at his Election, and therfore the King deceived in his Grant.</p>
               <p>And further, here he hath made Conuſance for the Fuell, without making mention of their Election, to have it one way, or another before the taking; but all the Court agreed that the Conuſance was good, and that the return ſhall be awarded to him who made the Conuſance: firſt, becauſe that this caſe is quite out of the caſe of Election, becauſe the rent which is granted is only out of the Fagots and Aſtlewood, and the 20 <hi>s.</hi> granted is not as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing, but granted as a recompence or ſatiſfaction of that, becauſe the Grant is of the Fagots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of 20 <hi>s.</hi> for the ſame; ſo that in ſuch a caſe the Seiſin of the 20 <hi>s.</hi> is a good Seiſin of the Fagots and Focals, and ſufficeth to maintain an Aſſiſe upon this Seiſin for the Fuell, but not for the 20 <hi>s.</hi> as money paid for Suit of Court is good Seiſin of the Suit: And the 20 <hi>s.</hi> here is not granted in nature of a Rent of ſo much, but as an allowance in ſatisfaction for the Fuell.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Popham</hi> conceived, that he ſhall have an Action of debt for this 20 <hi>s.</hi> for the fuell, after the Election made if he will, as for a <hi>Nomine poene,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the principall thing granted of which the Inheritance is, but a caſuall Accident in recompence therof if he will have it, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he may diſtrain for it, becauſe it is ſo limited to be done by the Grant it ſelf: But they ſhall never have aſſurance of the 20 <hi>s.</hi> as a thing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, becauſe it is not the thing of which the Inheritance is granted, but only granted in allowance and ſatisfaction of it, and therfore not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the caſes where 20. quarters of Corn, or 20 <hi>s.</hi> Rent is granted to

one and his Heirs, or other ſuch thing which ſtands meerly in the diſjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, <hi>to wit,</hi> to have, or take, the one, or the other.</p>
               <p>And therfore ſuppoſe the Prior was to carry the Fuell yearly to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall at the Feaſt of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> and yet then the Maſter and Brethren might have refuſed the Fuell, and held themſelves to have the 20 <hi>s.</hi> by force of the Grant, for then originally the Election ought to have been made there: But upon the Covenant which cometh afterwards on the other part, the notice ought to have been given in <hi>April</hi> yearly before, but if it be not done, there lies but an Action of Covenant for the not doing of it, for this will not alter the nature of the Grant which was full and perfect in Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And here he needs not make this appearance in the Conuſance, that any Election was made before the taking of the Cattel, becauſe the Grant is of the Fuell it ſelf, and if the other had made Election before to have the 20 <hi>s.</hi> for the Fuell, this ought to have been ſhewn on the other ſide in Bar of the Avowry, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he brought to them the Fuell yearly according to the Grant, and that they refuſed it, and required the 20 <hi>s.</hi> every time for it, in which caſe for every ſuch refuſall and Election to have the 20 <hi>s.</hi> for it, it had excluded him to have any Fuell for this year ſo refuſed.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Popham</hi> alſo, you may ſee a great diverſity between this caſe, where a man is to deliver to another 20. Loads of Wood, or 20.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> Mordant <hi>was ſeiſed of the Farm, in his Demeſne as of Fee, and ſo ſeiſed, demiſed it to</hi> Philip Fernam, Elizabeth <hi>his wife, and</hi> Iohn Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi>the eldeſt Son of the ſaid</hi> Philip, <hi>for term of their lives, and of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor of them, and the ſaid</hi> Eliz. <hi>died, after which the ſaid</hi> Philip <hi>his Father demiſed his part of the Farm by his Deed indented, dated</hi> 13.

               <p>And further, he had no power to diſpoſe therof beyond his own life; for ſuppoſe that he makes a Leaſe therof for years, and afterwards grant over his Eſtate to a ſtranger, and dies, the Leaſe for years is therby determined, albeit his joynt Companion be yet living, and that his Eſtate continues.</p>
               <p>And yet he agreed, that if had made a Leaſe for years, to begin at a day to come, as at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, or the like, that this had been good, for it is an Intereſt in the Grantee to be granted over for the preſumption, that it might be executed in his life; but in the other caſe there is not any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that he who hath not but for his life, can demiſe it to begin after the Eſtate made to him is determined.</p>

                  <hi>Sir Iohn Packington Knight, enfeoffed therof one Ralph Woodliff, to have and to hold to him and his Heirs, upon condition, that if the ſaid Sir Iohn within a year after the death of the ſaid Ralph, pay to the Heirs, Executors, or Adminiſtrators of the ſaid Ralph, the ſumm of a</hi> 100. <hi>marks of lawfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that then the ſaid Feoffment and Seiſin made therupon ſhall be void; Ralph Woodliff made a Feoment over to others therof, and died inteſtate, and Adminiſtration was committed to Anne his Wife, and Drew Woodliff his Son and Heir, who gave a Warrant of Attorney to Thomas Goodale then ſeiſed of the ſaid Meadow by mean conveyances, for the receit of the ſaid</hi> 100. <hi>marks, with Covenant that none of them ſhall do any act, or thing that ſhall be pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:53226:55"/>
                  <hi>the ſaid Goodale that this Warrant was made to him: After which it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between the ſaid Sir Ioh Packington &amp; Drew Woodale, that the ſaid Tho. Drew ſhall have but</hi> 32 <hi>l. of the ſaid</hi> 100. <hi>marks, wherupon the ſaid Sir Iohn Packington within a year after the death of the ſaid Ralph Woodliff paid to the ſaid Drew Woodliff the</hi> 100. <hi>marks, and preſently the ſaid Drew delivered to the ſaid Sir John all the</hi> 100. <hi>marks but</hi> 32 <hi>l.</hi> And the Verdict ſtands upon this point, whether the 100. marks were well paid, or not.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Gawdy</hi> this was meerly a fraud which ſhall never prejudice a third perſon, for if it be agreed between the Diſſeiſee and <hi>I. S.</hi> that a ſtranger ſhall diſſeiſe the Tenant of the Land, and enfeoff the ſaid <hi>I. S.</hi> to the intent that the Diſſeiſee ſhall recover againſt him, this Recovery ſhall bind the ſaid <hi>I. S.</hi> but not him who was diſſeiſed, and yet he who recovered had a good Title, and paramount the other, but he ſhall not come to that to which he had good cauſe of Action and Title by fraudulent means, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of a third perſon, not party to this fraud.</p>
               <p>And it was ſaid further, that to pay money, and take it away again preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before that it is purſed up by re-delivery, is not properly a payment, but rather a colour of payment.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Fennor</hi> and <hi>Popham,</hi> the force of a Deed of Feoffment once effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, cannot become void or of no effect, nor the Livery therupon by ſuch manner of words. And it is not like a Bargain of Goods, or an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a Leaſe for years, which by ſuch words may be diſſolved and made to be of no force or effect, becauſe that as by the ſealing a bare Contract, it may be made perfect and effectuall without other circumſtances, ſo may it be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch bare means without other circumſtance: But ſo it is not in caſe of an Inheritance or Free-hold, which cannot be effectual by the bare delivery of a Deed, unleſſe that Livery be made therupon.</p>
               <p>And all agreed, that as this caſe is, notwithſtanding the Feoffment made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by the Father, the money might have been paid to the Heir to perform the Condition, if they had been duly paid, and without Covin, and that the words had been apt to have defeated the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Clench,</hi> If a Feoffment be made to one upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">In which caſe a Condition ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to an Aſſignee, and not to the Heir.</note> of payment of money to the Feoffee, his Heirs or Aſſignes and the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee makes a Feoffment over, and dies, the money ought to be paid to the Feoffee who is the Aſſignee, and not to the Heir, for there <hi>(Heir)</hi> is not named but in reſpect of the Inheritance which might be in him, but here he is named as a meer ſtranger to it.</p>

And therfore <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, that by ſo many Fines which have been levied in ſuch a manner, and to ſuch who have Land in the ſame Towns where the Conuſance hath been (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that alwaies more Land is compriſed in Fines by number of acres, then men have, or is intended to paſſe) by them at ſome time, or in ſome age, it would have come in queſtion if the Law had been taken as <hi>Manwood</hi> took it, but in all ſuch caſes the Poſſeſſion hath alwaies gone otherwiſe, which ſhews how the Law hath been alwaies taken in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>And therfore if a man be to paſſe his Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> to another by Fine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory, and he levy the Fine to him by the name of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and of ſo many acres of Land in <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> being the Towns in which the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor lies, after which the Conuzor purchaſeth other Lands in theſe Towns, the Fine before the Statute of Vſes ſhall not be executed of theſe Lands pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed after the Conuſance, and the Fine ſhall work to theſe which he had power and intent to paſſe, and no further.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemed to them, that an Vſe may be averred without Deed upon a Fine <hi>ſur Render.</hi> And all agreed that if there had been a Deed to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the purport of the Fine, that the Fine ſhall not be taken to extend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then is compriſed in the Deed. And what is the cauſe therof, the Deed or the intent of the parties? and none can ſay but that it is the intent of the parties, and not the Deed, and the intent may as well appear without the Deed, as with it, albeit it be not ſo concluſive by Parole as by Deed.</p>
               <p>And therfore ſuppoſe I have 100. acres of Land in a Cloſe in <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> hath another 100. acres in the ſame Cloſe and Town, and <hi>I.

               <p>And it ſeemed convenient to all the Iuſtices and Barons that he ſhall be executed, and that the matter was cleer in this caſe, becauſe the principall did not take advantage of his firſt Attainder by way of Plea, but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deed, in which caſe the Acceſſary may well be Arraigned: But if the principall had pleaded his former Attainder, whether now he ſhall be put to anſwer for the benefit of the Queen, having regard to this Acceſſary, who otherwiſe ſhall go quit, becauſe there was not any principall, but he who was formerly attainted.</p>

               <p>But he agreed, that the party Attaint ſhall not be again Arraigned for any other Felony done before the Attainder, in caſe where no Acceſſary was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the Statute of 8 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. he who is convict of Felony, and hath his Clergy after his purgation made, ſhall be Arraigned for another Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny done before the conviction, if it be ſuch for which he cannot have his Clergy, and was not convicted or acquitted of the ſame Felony before the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder: But upon this Statute it appeareth, that he who ſhall have his Clergy in ſuch manner, ſhall not be drawn in queſtion for any other Felony done before his Attainder, for which he might have his Clergy.</p>

And it was moved that the Iudgment given was erroneous, in as much as the firſt act was to be done by <hi>John Scot</hi> before the new Leaſe was to be made, <hi>to wit,</hi> the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the former Leaſe, and the drawing of the new one ought to have been done by the Plaintiff, which not being done on his part, the ſaid Sir <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is not bound to make the new Leaſe.</p>
               <p>And alſo it was moved, that as the caſe is here, the ſaid <hi>John Scot</hi> might ſurrender to the Defendant, notwithſtanding the intervening of this Leaſe between the Leaſe of the Plaintiff, and the Inheritance of the Defendant, as if a man make a Leaſe for years in poſſeſſion, and afterwards make another Leaſe to a ſtranger, to begin after the end of the former Leaſe, this ſhall not hinder but that the firſt Leaſe may be ſurrendred to him who was the Leſſor, notwithſtanding the ſaid Term intervening.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered by the Court, that the Plaintiff here need not to make any offer of the ſurrender of his Term to the ſaid Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> in as much as the ſaid Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> hath diſabled himſelf to take the Surrender, or to take the Leaſe according to the purport of the Condition, and by this diſabling of himſelf the Obligation is forfeited, <hi>Come per</hi> 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. and by <hi>Littleton</hi> alſo, If a man make a Feoffment, upon condition to re-enfeoff him, this is not to be done untill requeſt therof be made by the Feoffor, yet if in the mean time the Feoffee ſuffer a fained recovery of the Land, grant a Rent charge, acknowledgeth a Statute, taketh a Wife, or the like, the Feoffor may re-enter, without requeſt made to re-enfeoff him, and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by any of theſe the Feoffee hath diſabled himſelf to perform the Condition in the ſame plight, as he might have done at the time of the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſame manner here, for by this render by the Fine, the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion paſſe in right, ſo that the Termor in poſſeſſion attorning to it, they ſhall have the Rent reſerved upon the firſt Leaſe, and therfore the Plaintiff cannot now ſurrender to the ſaid Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> but to the Grantees of the Reverſion, and therfore there ſhall be no prejudice to the Plaintiff, becauſe the Defendant was the cauſe of diſabling the Plaintiff to make the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him. And ſuppoſe it be but a Term to begin at a day to come, yet by this the Obligation is forfeited, becauſe the Obligor hath therby diſabled himſelf to perform the Condition in ſuch a plight as he might have done it when the Obligation was made, wherby the Obligation is preſently forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, albeit the Plaintiff never ſurrender nor offer to do it: And therfore the Iudgment there was affirmed.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53226:60"/>
of the Aſſiſe, in manner and form as the Writ ſuppoſeth: And further that the ſaid <hi>Weſt</hi> therof diſſeiſed the ſaid <hi>Mounſon,</hi> namely of the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the will of one <hi>Mounſon:</hi> And did not find either the words of the Will, nor the Will it ſelf what it was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe upon this Verdict upon advice with the other Iuſtices, gave Iudgment, that the Plaintiff ſhall recover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which a Writ of Error was brought in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> where it was moved that the Iudgment was erroneous: Firſt, becauſe the Iury have not found that the Defendant was Tenant of the Free-hold, agreeing with the form of the Plea, for the Writ of Aſſiſe doth not ſuppoſe him to be Tenant of the Free-hold, and therfore the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in this point not fully found.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Error is, that the Seiſin of the Plaintiff is not required of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the charge given to them, as well as the Diſſeiſen, for the charge was that they ſhould enquire of the Seiſen of the Plaintiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to both theſe the Court anſwered that the Verdict is well enough, notwithſtanding theſe exceptions, for every Aſſiſe brought ſuppoſeth that there is a Diſſeiſor, and a Tenant named in it, then this Aſſiſe being brought againſt a ſole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuppoſeth him to be a Diſſeiſor and Tenant alſo; and therfore the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſaying, that he was Tenant as the Writ ſuppoſeth, is now as ſtrong in this caſe, as if they had found that he was Tenant of the Free-hold, for the Tenant of the Free-hold ought to be named in the Writ: But if the Aſſiſe had been brought againſt two, or more, ſuch a Verdict had not been good, for it ſufficeth if any of them be Tenant of the Freehold, and then the Writ doth not ſuppoſe one to be Tenant more then another, but ſuppoſeth one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be named in the Writ. And therfore in ſuch a caſe the finding ought to be ſpeciall, <hi>to wit,</hi> that ſuch a one is Tenant of the Free-hold, or that there is a Tenant of the Free-hold named in the Writ. But where one only is named in the Writ to be Diſſeiſor and Tenant, it is ſufficient to find as here, for by this it is certainly found that he is Tenant of the Free-hold.</p>
               <p>And for the other point, although it be a good direction for the Iudges to the Iury, wherby they may the better perceive that there ought to be a Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin in him, or otherwiſe there cannot be a Diſſeiſen by the other, yet in Deed he cannot be a Diſſeiſed who was not then ſeiſed: But the Aſſiſe having found the Diſſeiſen the Seiſen in Law, is found included in the Diſſeiſen. But for the point moved, that the Verdict was not perfect, in as much as they found the Diſſeiſen with a <hi>Niſi,</hi> it ſeemed to <hi>Gawdy</hi> that the Iudgment upon this Verdict was erronious, as where a Verdict in another Action is imperfect, a <hi>Venire facias de novo</hi> ſhall be awarded to try the Iſſue again: And if Iudgment be given upon ſuch a Verdict it is error; ſo here the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in this point being incertain, there ought to have been a Certificate of Aſſiſe to have this better opened: But the three other Iuſtices held (as the caſe is) that the Verdict in this point is certain enough, for that which cometh before the <hi>Niſi</hi> (as it is placed) is meerly nugator. as in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Rowland Heyward,</hi> the Iury found <hi>Non aſſumpſit,</hi> but if ſuch Witneſſes ſay true (as they believe they did) <hi>Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, &amp;c.</hi> it was but a meer nugation.</p>
               <p>But it ſeemed to <hi>Popham,</hi> that if the Verdict had been, if the words of the Will do not paſſe the Land, then that he diſſeiſed, and if they paſſe, then that he did not diſſeiſe; there if the words of the Will be not found, the Verdict had been all imperfect, but here the Verdict is full and perfect before the <hi>Niſi, &amp;c.</hi> and therfore the Iudgment was affirmed.</p>

And by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Clench</hi> the Iudgment is to be affirmed; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the acceptance of the ſaid Rent had been by the hands of one who was to pay it, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Tenant himſelf, yet this ſhall not bar the right of Intail in the ſaid <hi>Robert Holme</hi> (as a releaſe of his right ſhould do) but this acceptance ſhall only forecloſe him of his Action, to demand the Land during his life, and therfore the right which the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> had, being barred by the Fine, the Son is without remedy, for the Son ſhall never have remedy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fine levied in time of his Father, the five years after the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations being paſſed: But in caſe where the right begin firſt to be a right in the Son, and not where there was right in the Father.</p>
               <p>And further, it ſeemed to them, that the payment of him who had not any thing in the Land at the time of the payment, as here, ſhall make no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him who accept it, becauſe this payment is as none in Law.</p>
               <p>And by them the Rejoynder of the Traverſe, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that <hi>Henry Gee</hi> was ſeiſed at the time of the payment in Fee, in right of his ſaid Wife, in manner and form, as in the Replication is ailedged, is good enough, for he traverſeth that which the Demandant hath ſpecially alledged to deſtroy the Bar, and contrary to that which is alledged, it ſhall not be intended that they had other particular Eſtate at the time of the payment, which may make the payment to be good.</p>
               <p>And albeit the Traverſe had been, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> was ſeiſed in right of his ſaid Wife, <hi>Modo &amp; forma prout,</hi> the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hath alledged without ſaying in Fee, as it is pleaded here, yet the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be put to find it, if he were ſeiſed in Fee, <hi>In jure Uxoris,</hi> and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particular Eſtate, as in 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4.

In Treſpaſſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant juſtifies the entry and ſowing of Corn, becauſe that <hi>M.</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee, and ſowed the Land, and the Defendant as his Servant entred and cut it, the Plaintiff ſaith, that it was his Free-hold at the time of the ſowing, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that it was the Free-hold of the ſaid <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>per Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> it is not good, for ſuch matter was not alledged by the Defendant, but he ought to traverſe the Seiſin in Fee, which was alledged, and good, and ſo it is good here.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems to <hi>Clench,</hi> that the Replication is not good, becauſe he doth not ſay, by the Writing upon which the Reſervation was made, which concludes <hi>Robert</hi> by his acceptance, <hi>Hic in Curia prolat.</hi> as by <hi>Hill.</hi> 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15. If a man will bar a woman of her Action for her Land after the death of her Husband, by Feoffment made by the Baron and Feme, during the Coverture by Deed, rendring Rent, by reaſon of acceptance of the ſaid Rent after the death of the husband, he ought to ſhew the Deed, and ſay, <hi>Hic in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria prolat.</hi> or otherwiſe the Plea is not good, becauſe that in ſuch a caſe albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it were a Gift in Tail, the wife ſhall not be concluded by her acceptance, unleſſe that the Gift were by Deed.</p>

                  <hi>Popham,</hi> True it is, in caſe the party will demur upon it: but ſuppoſe in this caſe, the Tenants had expreſly acknowledged the ſaid Feoffments, and then concluded afterwards as they have done here, ſhall they afterwards take advantage of not ſhewing the Deed? I think that not, no more here where they admit it, and plead the other matter to avoid the concluſion; for if a double Plea be plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And of this opinion <hi>Gawdy</hi> was, ſaying, in as much as the Obligation is, that he ſhall be paid according to the true intent of the Articles, the intent of them is not that the Rent ſhall be paid if any Land be not paſſed by them, for it ſhould be paid, as by 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. if a man be bound to pay a Rent which is reſerved upon a Leaſe made to him, he ought to pay it at his peril: But if it be to pay it accordingly to the Leaſe, there he ſaid, it is not payable but upon the Bond, and is to be paid as a Rent. And if the Land be evicted in the interim before the day of payment, the Obligor ſhall help himſelf by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it upon ſuch an Obligation to diſcharge the Bond, ſo here: But it ſeemed to <hi>Popham,</hi> that the Iudgment was well given, and yet he agreed the Caſes that were put; but he ſaid there was a diverſity where the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation goes in the generality, and where it tends to a ſpeciality: for as by 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. If a man be bound to be Non-ſuit in all Actions which he hath againſt

ſuch a one, or to aſſure to another all his Lands in <hi>Dale,</hi> he may ſay, that he hath not any Suit, or that he hath no Land in <hi>Dale:</hi> But if it be that he ſhall be Non-ſuit in a <hi>Formedon</hi> depending, or to enfeoff him of <hi>White acre,</hi> there it is no plea, becauſe he refers to a ſpecial point. And by 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. If a man be bound to another to pay him 10 <hi>l.</hi> for which a ſtranger is bound to the ſaid Obligee, it is no plea for him to ſay, that the ſtranger is not bound to pay him 10 <hi>l.</hi> for when the Condition refers to ſuch a ſpeciall matter, this cannot be denied of him who is bound.</p>
               <p>And therfore in this caſe the Defendant cannot ſay, that there were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Articles, contrary to that which is ſpecially compriſed in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6.

                  </note> and Sir <hi>Henry Backley</hi> Knight, Defendant, the caſe upon the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeareth to be thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſaid Earl was ſeiſed in his Demeſn as of Fee, of the Mannor of</hi> Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trift, <hi>in the County of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>to which Mannor the Office of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Foreſt of</hi> Selwood, <hi>in the ſame County belongeth, and alſo that there was before time of memory, an Office within the ſame Foreſt called the</hi> Lievtenant-ſhip, <hi>or</hi> Cuſtody <hi>of the ſaid Foreſt belonging to the ſaid Mannor, of which alſo the ſaid Earl was ſeiſed in his Demeſn as of Fee: And that there was one part of the ſaid Foreſt called the</hi> Weſt part <hi>of the ſaid Foreſt, in which there were two Walks, or Bayliwicks, the one called</hi> Staverdale walk, <hi>and the other</hi> Brewick walk: <hi>And that the ſaid Lievtenant had the charge of the Deer, and the diſpoſition and appointment of the Keepers of the ſaid Foreſt. And that the ſaid Earl being ſo ſeiſed, by his Writing, bearing date</hi> 5. Novemb. 12. Eliz. <hi>reciting that his Father had granted the Office of Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-ſhip, and Deputy-ſhip, of the ſaid Weſt part of the ſaid Foreſt,</hi> Cum vadiis, &amp;c. quando acciderit, <hi>and the Keeper-ſhip of</hi> Brewick-walk <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to the ſaid Sir</hi> Maurice Barkley <hi>Knight, and the Heirs Males of his body, and inſtituted and ordained him, and the Heirs Males of his body, Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and Deputy therof to the ſaid Earl and his Heirs, confirmed the Grant aforeſaid.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And further by the ſame Deed granted and confirmed to the ſaid Sir</hi> Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, <hi>and to the Heirs Males of his body, the ſaid Lievtenant-ſhip and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſhip of the ſaid Weſt part of the ſaid Foreſt, and alſo the Keeper-ſhip of the ſaid Walk called</hi> Staverdale <hi>Walk, together with the Lodges, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Provided alſo, and the ſaid Sir</hi> Maurice <hi>covenanted, granted, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for him, and the Heirs Males of his body, to, and with the ſaid Earl, his Heirs and Aſſigns, that the ſaid Sir</hi> Maurice <hi>and the Heirs Males of his body, and their Aſſignee, and Aſſignees, will preſerve the Games as fair as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hath been uſed, and that neither the ſaid</hi> Maurice, <hi>nor any of the Heirs Males of his body, nor any of their Aſſignees, will cut any manner of Wood growing upon any part of the Premiſſes, unleſſe for neceſſary Brouſe, and ſuch as they may lawfully cut of their own, and as was accuſtomed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Sir</hi> Maurice died, <hi>and Sir</hi> Henry Barkley <hi>his Son and Heir Male, cut four Okes within the ſaid Walk called</hi> Brewicks, <hi>growing upon the ſoile of the Queen there, every one of them being Timber, and of the value of</hi> 13 s. 4 d. <hi>and converted them to his own uſe. And whether by this act done by the ſaid Sir</hi> Henry <hi>the now Earl of</hi> Pembrook, <hi>may re-enter into the things granted by him, was the queſtion, which ſtands upon two points, the firſt, Whether the laſt</hi> Proviſo <hi>makes a Condition, or be but a meer Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether this Act makes a Forfeiture of the ſaid Offices granted as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the courſe of the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaudey, Clench, Walmſley,</hi> and <hi>Beamont,</hi> that the firſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> is not a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53226:63"/>
Condition, either becauſe he is not by this to do more then he may do by his ſuperior cuſtody, in which caſe he ought to do it by his own authority, as to take his fee Deer, or to chaſe and kill Deer by Warrant, and the like; or otherwiſe if it ſhall be taken, that he may by this <hi>Proviſo</hi> kill or chaſe the Game at his pleaſure, it is void, becauſe as to it, he is to do that which he ought not to do by his Office, <hi>to wit,</hi> to deſtroy the Game, which by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he is to preſerve; and therfore for the firſt, it ſtands meerly upon the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Then when he ſaith further in the ſecond clauſe; Provided alſo, and the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Barkley</hi> covenants, this is to be intended that it ſhall be as the other for the word alſo, and this is but a bare Covenant as the firſt was.</p>
               <p>And they ſaid further, that this laſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhall be ſaid entirely the words of the Grantee himſelf, as the Covenant is, and without words of the Grantor a Condition cannot be, for it is for him to condition with the Eſtate given, and not for him to whom the Grant is made; And therfore ſuppoſe that it had been on the other part, <hi>to wit,</hi> Provided alwaies, and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor covenant that the Grantee ſhall have the refuſe of the brouſe, and the like; this ſhall not be ſaid to be any Condition, but a meer Covenant: In like manner ſhall it be on the other part.</p>
               <p>And further it is common for Scriveners and ignorant perſons to make in effect every Covenant to begin with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in this manner, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to expound ſuch a manner of <hi>Proviſo</hi> as a Condition, it ſhall be too peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Eſtates of men.</p>
               <p>And for the caſe upon the Leaſe made by Serjeant <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dloes,</hi> which was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provided alwaies, and it was covenanted, granted and agreed between the parties, if the Leſſee ſell, or alien the term that the Leſſor ſhall have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,</hi> This they agreed to be a good Condition, as was adjudged in the Common Bench, 32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but the caſe there is, becauſe they are the words as well of the Leſſor, who may add a Condition to the Eſtate, as of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee who made the Covenant, which is not here. But they ſaid, that the caſe between <hi>Hamington</hi> and <hi>Pepull</hi> which was 17 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, was more nigh in reſemblance to the caſe in queſtion, which was that the ſaid <hi>Pepull</hi> made a Leaſe for years to <hi>Hamington</hi> of a Farm, except the wood, and covenanted with the Leſſee that he ſhall take all manner of under-wood; provided alwaies, and the Leſſee covenant that he will not cut any manner of Timber-tree, &amp; this was adjudged no Condition. And as to the other point they ſaid, that the cutting of Trees by him who had the cuſtody of the Foreſt, is not a forfeiture of his Office by the Common Law, as it is of him who hath the cuſtody of a Park, for there is another ſpeciall Officer who hath the charge of wood in a Foreſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Verderer and the Woodward, and therfore it is no forfeiture of him who hath the cuſtody of the Foreſt to cut Trees, for he hath another charge, <hi>to wit,</hi> the cuſtody of the Game on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not of the Wood.</p>
               <p>And further the cutting of one or two Trees is no cauſe of forfeiture, for it may be that there is Covert-ſhade and brouſe ſufficient of that which yet remains, in which caſe it is no forfeiture if it be not averred that theſe things are impaired by it.</p>
               <p>But the chief Iuſtices, chief Baron and all the other Iuſtices and Barons were of a contrary opinion. And for the matter of forfeiture at Common Law, they ſaid that it was a cauſe of forfeiture of an Office at common Law to cut the Trees, as well in the caſe of a Foreſter, as in caſe of a Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, for the Foreſter hath not only the charge of the Game, but of all that is within the Foreſt by which the Game is fed, preſerved, or ſuccoured,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53226:64"/>
and they are fed by the brouſe, and ſuccoured by the ſhade, and have the calmer and better lodging by reaſon of the Trees; and therfore by their Office they are to have a care of theſe things as well as of the Game, for without theſe the Game cannot ſtand: as to ſay, that there are others who have ſpeciall charge of the Wood and Paſture, as the Woodward, or Agiſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is no proof that the Foreſters, or Keepers are diſcharged therby.</p>
               <p>And the Foreſters and Keepers are by their Offices to preſent the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers in the Woods within the Foreſts of the Wood-wards, and therfore they have to do with it. And by <hi>Carta de foreſta,</hi> none may cut his wood within his Foreſt, <hi>Niſi per viſum Foreſtraii, ergo</hi> the Foreſters have charge therof: And every voluntary act done by an Officer contrary to that which belongs to his Office is a forfeiture of his Office, as by voluntary killing of Bucks, cutting of Trees, Wood, or the like: but otherwiſe it is of things done or ſuffered by his negligence if it be not common or often. And albeit the Trees here were not many, or that it was not averred that the Game was to be hurt therby, yet it cannot be intended but that it is ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by it, as it ſhould be by the killing of a Buck in the Foreſt, by which the Office ſhall be forfeited, becauſe the Game is therby the worſe, and yet there may be Game ſufficient without this Buck, but he hath voluntarily done a thing contrary to his Office, and therfore it is a Forfeiture of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſo it ſhall be in this caſe.</p>
               <p>And for the other point they ſaid, it was a Condition and alſo a Covenant, and it was for good purpoſe to have it to be ſo: For ſuppoſe that the Game had been deſtroyed by the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> ſhall this he a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or ſatisfaction to enter for the Condition broken? No, and therfore the Covenant was made to recompence him for Damages.</p>
               <p>And when u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then ſuppoſe here, that the <hi>Proviſo</hi> had been; <hi>Provided alwaies that the Grantee ſhall not cut any Tree,</hi> And the Grantee covenant alſo that he will not cut any Tree, this is plainly a Condition and alſo a Covenant; then it is as plain in the caſe in queſtion, which is; <hi>Provided alſo, and the Grantee covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he will not cut any manner of Wood:</hi> diſtinguiſh the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by his proper diſtinction, and it is cleer that it is a Condition as well as a Covenant.

               <p>And to ſay, that the laſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhall not be a Condition, becauſe the firſt cannot enure as a Condition, becauſe that which is to be done may lawfully be done with it, or without it, or becauſe that the matter to which the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is annexed, is repugnant to the nature of the thing granted, yet this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the nature of the word it ſelf, but by reaſon of that to which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> is annexed, and therfore the <hi>Proviſo</hi> following hindred in its operation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53226:64"/>
by meanes of the word, <hi>alſo:</hi> And therefore if a man makes a Leaſe for yeers, provided alwayes that the leſſor may enjoy and hold the Mannors of <hi>D.</hi> (which is other Land) or that the Leſſee ſhall kill <hi>I. S.</hi> theſe are void of Conditions; But grant then that it is further provided alſo that he ſhall not alien his Terme, is not this a good Condition although that which was Precedent was no Condition? It is cleer that is not; And they ſaid for <hi>Hamingtons</hi> Caſe that it was but of the nature of a declaration with what wood the Leſſee ſhall meddle, becauſe it depends upon the Covenant of the Leſſor, and it is generall, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he may cut any manner of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, provided that he do not cut any manner of Timber; and <hi>Popham</hi> was of councell with <hi>Hamington</hi> in this caſe, and the Court at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inſiſted much that it was a Condition, and that for the reaſon then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it depended upon the Covenant of the Leſſor, which was general for all manner of under-wood, becauſe that Standels growing between great Trees, might be taken within the generall words of all manner of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, for to make it plain it was well put in, that he ſhall not cut any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Timber Trees, and therfore in this point it was but a Declaration, with what wood he ſhould meddle, although in truth it was of another thing then was compriſed in the Covenant before: And then the adding of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to ſuch a <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhall not make the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of another nature, then it was before the Covenant made, or if no Covenant had been added to it, and upon this reaſon the Court then gave Iudgment for <hi>Hamington.</hi> And by him, if I am ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> in <hi>D.</hi> and of <hi>Black acre</hi> in <hi>D.</hi> and ſo ſeiſed, I covenant with <hi>I. S.</hi> that he ſhall enjoy the ſaid Mannor for ten years: Provided and the ſaid <hi>I.

               <p>And for the <hi>Proviſo</hi> here, he put this caſe, ſuppoſe it had been; <hi>Provided, and the Grantee covenants that he ſhall not cut any Trees:</hi> None will deny but that this had been a Condition and a Covenant alſo: And what diverſity is there where the word is at the concluſion, and ſo couple the Condition and Covenant together.

               <p>And they agreed, that where a principall Officer is by his Office to make inferior Officers under him, and the inferior Officer commits a forfeiture, the ſuperior Officer ſhall take advantage therof, and ſhall place a new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, as was done in 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. for the Office of the Marſhall of the Kings Bench, put in by the great Marſhall of <hi>Englang.</hi>

               <p>But in the laſt caſe the privity of contract is not diſſolved between the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and the Leſſee, notwithſtanding the Leſſee hath paſſed over his Term, neither is the contract therby determined between the parties.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fennor</hi> ſaid, that in this caſe the privity in Deed is gone by the death of the Leſſee, and therfore the Executor who is but privy in Law, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Action, unleſſe in caſe where he hath the Term; in which caſe he ſhall be charged as he who hath <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> which is not in the caſe here.</p>
               <p>And he ſaid further, that a Leaſe made by a Prebend is good no longer then his own life, but is meerly void by his death, and therfore ſhall not be ſaid to be a contract to bind further then his life, and therfore alſo he ſaid, that the Action will not lye in the ſaid caſe for the Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſaid, that here the Leaſe is confirmed, and therfore good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Term, but it ſeemed to him that the Executor who is but in privy in Law ſhall not be chargable with this action, for the arrearages due after the aſſignment over, and yet he agreed that the Heir, the Succeſſor, and the Executor of the Leſſor ſhall have debt againſt the Leſſee himſelf, for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages which accrues to be due after the aſſignment over of the Leaſe:

               <p>But on the other part it was argued by <hi>Richardſon</hi> the Kings Serjeant, <hi>Banks,</hi> and all the Iuſtices, that Execution ſhall be awarded in no other manner againſt the Heir then it ſhould be againſt his Anceſtor, or other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſor, <hi>to wit,</hi> of a Moyety of that which he had by diſcent, for as much as in this caſe he cannot be to this purpoſe charged as Heir, but he ought to be charged as Ter-tenant and as a Purchaſor, and a Purchaſor ſhall never hurt himſelf but his falſe Plea.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Banks</hi> argued, that the Heir in this caſe is charged as a Purchaſor, and the falſe Plea of a Purchaſor ſhall never charge himſelf, 33 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz.</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, 162. and 6 <hi>E</hi> 3. 15. and that in this caſe he is charged as Ter-tenant appears by three reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Debt will not lye againſt an Heir, but where he is bound as Heir, but in this caſe Execution is to be ſued againſt him as another Ter-tenant, <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 271. 11 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. and in 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6.

               <p n="2">2. There is not any lien as Heir, for the Iudgment doth not mention the Heir, and therfore he cannot be charged unleſſe he be expreſly bound, and in the Record of the Recovery, it doth not appear that the firſt lien ſhall bind the Heir, for he declares that he bound himſelf, and not that he bound himſelf and his Heirs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Heir were bound in the Obligation ſo that he were once bound as Heir, yet the Iudgment determines the ſpecialty, ſo that now he is not bound, and in the Iudgment the Heir is not mentioned, as in 10 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 21. 24. If an Abbot contract to the uſe of the houſe without conſent of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, this ſhall bind if he dies, but if he takes an Obligation of the Abbot and then he dies, this ſhall not bind the houſe, for the Contract is determined by the Obligation, and this is the reaſon that in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. in a recovery upon debt the Obligation was cancelled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here he cannot be charged as Heir, for it appeareth by the Record <note place="margin">Where a debt is recorded upon bond the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled.</note> that his Father is living, for it is brought againſt him as Heir apparant, which he cannot be but during the life of his Father.</p>
               <p>And as to the objection, that in this caſe he ſhall have his age, and therfore ſhall be charged as Heir, <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> for if execution be ſued againſt the Heir of a Purchaſor, he ſhall have his age, and yet he is not Heir, neither can charged as Heir to the Conuſor: But becauſe it is a rule in Law, that the Heir which hath by diſcent ſhall not anſwer where his Inheritance may be charged during his Nonage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitlock</hi> to the ſame intent, becauſe the Heir is not charged here as Heir but as Ter-tenant, wherby his falſe Plea ſhall not hurt him, with which <hi>Jones</hi> alſo agreed, and ſaid, that he here conſidered three things.</p>
               <p>1. That the lien of the Anceſtor binds the Heir.</p>
               <p>2. How the Heir ſhall behave himſelf in pleading.</p>
               <p>3. Our point in queſtion. For the firſt there are two things requiſite to bind one as Heir. 1. A lien expreſſe, for if one bind himſelf and not his Heir, this ſhall not bind his Heir in any caſe. 2. A diſcent of Inheritance, for without this he ſhall not be bound by the act of his Anceſtor, and he is bound no longer then Aſſets diſcend, for he alien before the Writ purchaſed the lien is gone. 2. He ought to behave himſelf truly and plead truly, and confeſſe the aſſets diſcended to him, when debt is brought againſt him as heir, otherwiſe his own Lands ſhall be charged with the debt, as it is in <hi>Pepys</hi> caſe in <hi>Plow.

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:53226:82"/>
or <hi>Non ſum informatum, &amp;c.</hi> If the Iudgment paſſe upon them, that it ſhall be generall; I am not of that opinion, for the common experience of the Courts is, that ſuch a generall Iudgment ſhall not be given againſt the Heir; unleſſe it be upon a falſe plea pleaded, with which agrees <hi>Lawſons</hi> caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 81. and <hi>Henninghams</hi> caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 344. where the Iudgment paſſed by <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi> ſo that the ſaying in <hi>Plow.</hi> 440. <hi>a.</hi> that what way ſoever the Heir be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in debt, if he do not confeſſe the Aſſets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it ſhall be his proper debt, is not now taken for Law.</p>

And the Counſels of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of <hi>Bigamis, &amp;c.</hi> are expounded by Statutes how they ſhal be taken; ſo that it they have a Priviledge (as in truth they have) by the Popes Bulls, if it were not allowed in <hi>England,</hi> they are not of force to priviledge them againſt the Common Law of the Land for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes; but this was never here allowed.</p>
               <p>And now for the Preſcription this cannot help them, for Monks are not of Evangelicall Prieſthood, <hi>to wit</hi> capable of Tithes in the <hi>Pernamy,</hi> but meerly Lay-men, and then as the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> caſe is, they cannot preſcribe <hi>in non decimando;</hi> And <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith of them, that they are <hi>Merè laici,</hi> ſo that if their Priviledge were allowed, their Preſcription will not help them. The priviledge of <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> was by the Counſell generall of for their diſcharge, which denies that all religious perſons ſhould be diſcharged of Tithes of Lands in their own hands, <hi>Quamdiu, &amp;c.</hi> But afterwards <hi>Adrian</hi> reſtrained it to Templars, Hoſpitalars, and Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, omitting the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes;</hi> and the decree of <hi>Adrian</hi> was received alſo, wherby the Law took notice of the diſcharge of the ſaid three Orders. True it is, that the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> have a Bull of Pope Innocent the third, of diſcharge, and as large liberties as the Ciſtertians, but they never put this in ure: And it ſeems, 1. That there were of them 29. Abbots &amp; Abbys, and yet their priviledge is not mentioned in all the Books as the Ciſtertians is. 2. They complained to <hi>Gregory</hi> the nineth, that they were not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to put it in ure, and notwithſtanding this complaint and command of the Pope to the Clergy to allow them this priviledge, yet 24 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made againſt them in Parliament for claiming this priviledge: But the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. put this cut of doubt, for this put the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtertians in a premunire, for purchaſing and putting in execution Bulls of exemption of their Lands purchaſed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> had the ſame priviledge they ſhould not have been omitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But admit that the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> had this priviledge: I ſay, that the Plaintiff hath not applied this priviledge to himſelf, for he hath not averred in fact that at the time <hi>&amp;c. Propriis manibus excolebat, nec ad firman demit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

as in <hi>Dickenſons</hi> caſe, <hi>Novel lib. intr.</hi> 542. there it is expreſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the like caſe, as ours is here, and where the ſame priviledge as here is claimed, <hi>Quod manibus propriis excolebat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is that it is ſaid here, that after the Feoffment to him made, he was ſeiſed <hi>Et gaviſus fuit in propria manutenor,</hi> but he doth not ſay, that at the time of the Tithes due, <hi>gaviſus fuit, &amp;c.</hi> as he ought expreſly to have done, as appeareth by other caſes.</p>

                  <hi>Banks contra.</hi> 1. That it is a good cauſe of Prohibition. 2. That it is well applied to us.</p>
               <p>1. That the order of <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> is diſcharged of Tithes, that they had once this priviledge, hath been allowed by the other party, by the Bulls of the Pope, and that it was allowed and taken notice of, he proved by this that this Bull was confirmed by King <hi>John</hi> in the 24. year of his Raign, the Charter wherof he ſaid he had under Seal, and 22 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>membran.</hi> 5. there were 26. Abbeys of this order, and the King took them all into his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their Immunities, and 22 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>John de Gant</hi> having <hi>Jura Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> (where the Abbey is) confirmed to them this Bull, and alſo this hath been divers times allowed and decreed to them in Court Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian for ſuit of Tithes, as in the caſe of the Abbey of <hi>Bigham</hi> which was of the ſame order.</p>
               <p>And as to that which was objected, that if the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes</hi> had ſuch a priviledge as the Caſtertians in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. that the like proviſion would have been againſt them.</p>
               <p>As to this I anſwer, that ſuch a proviſion is not againſt the Templars nor Hoſpitalars, and yet they have ſuch a priviledge.</p>
               <p>2. It may be that they never enlarged their priviledged above their grant. And for the Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. our Priviledge was not then new, and it was afterwards allowed in 22 <hi>R.</hi> 2. And alſo I conceive, that if the Abbey were diſcharged at the time of the diſſolution, although not <hi>De jure,</hi> yet this is a ſufficient diſcharge within the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as it is taken <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 11. 14.</p>
               <p>2. I hold that they may here preſcribe to be diſcharged of Tithes, becauſe they are Spiritual perſons, and capable of cure of Souls, and capable of tithes in <hi>Pernamy,</hi> as if an Appropriation be made to them.</p>
               <p>3. It is not now to be argued, whether they have ſuch a priviledge, for they have demurred, which is a confeſſion of all matters in Fait, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And 5. The priviledge is well applied, becauſe it is ſhewn that they were once diſcharged.</p>

But the Court, <hi>to wit, Hobart</hi> chief Iuſtice, <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff, and yet they agreed, that if he had demurred upon the Declaration, it had not been good, and alſo that if it had been generall, <hi>Licet ſaepius requiſit,</hi> it had not been good, in as much as it is parcell of the promiſe, and therfore ought to be ſaid ſubſtantially; <hi>viz.</hi> That it was after the promiſe and payment of the 52 <hi>l.</hi> but the time is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by theſe words <hi>Poſtea,</hi> and there is no defect but in the place, and <hi>(Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtea)</hi> implies that it was after the promiſe and payment.</p>

In treſpaſſe the Defendant juſtifies by reaſon of a cuſtom that they which plow may turn their Plow upon the Land of another, and that for neceſſity, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for a good juſtification, and he hath more government of his Oxen, then in our caſe he can have of his Dog.</p>
               <p>If a man be making of a lawfull Chaſe, and cannot do it without damage to another, this is <hi>Damnum abſque injuria,</hi> 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 28. And he cited a caſe which was in <hi>Mich.</hi> 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> between <hi>Jenning</hi> and <hi>Mayſtore,</hi> where a man of neceſſity chaſed Sheep for taking one of his own, in treſpaſſe he may juſtifie it<hi>:</hi> And alſo if a Dog goes into the Land of another (as in this caſe) treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe does not lye, but otherwiſe it is of Cattell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crew</hi> chief Iuſtice, it ſeems to me that he might drive the Sheep out with the Dog, and he cold not withdraw his Dog when he would in an inſtant, and therfore it is not like to the caſe of 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Where treſpaſſe was brought for entring into a Warren, and there it was pleaded that there was a Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in his Land, and his Hawk flew and followed it into the Plaintiffs ground, and there it ſeems that it is not a good juſtification, for he may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Hawk, but cannot take the Pheaſant, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 4. a man cuts Thorns, and they fell into another mans Land, and in treſgaſſe he juſtified for it; and the opinion was, that notwithſtanding this juſtification treſpaſſe lies, becauſe he did not plead that he did his beſt endeavour to hinder their falling there, yet this was a hard caſe; But this caſe is not like to theſe caſes, for here it was lawfull to chaſe them out of his own Land, and he did his beſt endeavour to recall the Dog, and therfore treſpaſſe does not lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge</hi> Iuſtice agreed, for here was no hedge, and when he ſaw them out of his own ground, he rated the Dog, 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. this difference is taken, if I ſee Sheep in my Land, I may chaſe them out, but if another ſees them and chaſe them out, I may have treſpaſſe againſt him, becauſe he hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">For an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe action doth not lye.</note> my advantage; and the nature of a Dog is ſuch that he cannot be ruled ſuddenly, and here it appeareth to be an involuntary Treſpaſſe, 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>A man is driving Goods through a Town, and one of them goes into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans houſe, and he follows him, treſpaſſe doth not lye for this, becauſe it was involuntary, and a treſpaſſe ought to be done voluntarily, and ſo it is <hi>Injuria,</hi> and a hurt to another, and ſo it is <hi>Damnum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Deer be out of a Foreſt, the Owner of the Land where they are may hunt them, and if the Deer flye to the Foreſt, and the Hounds purſue him, then he ought to call in the Dogs, and ſo I may juſtifie, and treſpaſſe lies not.</p>

Treſpaſſe was brought for hunting and breaking of hedges, and the caſe was, that a man ſtarted a Fox in his own land, and his Hounds purſued him into another mans Lands, and it was holden that he may hunt and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him into any mans land, becauſe a Fox is a noyſom creature to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, that when a man is outlawed he hath <hi>Caput lupinum,</hi> and he may be hunted through all the County: And he agreed the caſe of 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4.

An Inquiſition was found upon an extent of a Statute-merchant, and doth not ſhew how the Conuſor was ſeiſed, but only that he was ſeiſed, and the Inquiſition holden void. But it may be objected, that if Land be given to a Dean and Chapiter that they have fee, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. I confeſſe it: But the conſtant uſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath alwais been in caſe of a Biſhop, Colledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſay, that they were ſeiſed in Fee, as appears in <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Granges</hi> caſe, and <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 6. the Dean and Chapiter of <hi>Worceſters</hi> caſe, and <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 11. 66. <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge caſe; and it appeareth by 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in the Abbey of S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> caſe, that an Abbey may have a Leaſe <hi>Prae auter vie,</hi> and ſo perhaps here the Dean had a Leaſe but <hi>Prae auter vie,</hi> and therfore ought to have alledged that he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Fee, if the truth were ſo.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Defendant entitles himſelf to a Rent, part of which was due in the time of the Teſtator, and part in his own time, and doth not ſhew when the Teſtator died, and therfore the Avowry not good.</p>

               <p>For the ſecond objection, becauſe <hi>Non profert literas teſtament,</hi> true it is if he entitle himſelf meerly as Executor, he ought to bring in <hi>Literas teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi> but our caſe is not ſo, for here we are Defendants, and we endeavour

               <p>For the third, that the death of the Teſtator doth not appear is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, for if any part be due to him, it is due as Executor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge,</hi> they ought to have pleaded that they were ſeiſed in Fee; true it is, that Land given to a Major and Comminalty is Fee-ſimple, and the reaſon is becauſe they are perpetuall, and if the Eſtate be not limitted they ſhall take according to their continuance, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8 <hi>Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayes</hi> caſe, they may be ſeiſed <hi>Prae terme dauter vie,</hi> but if they had pleaded that they were ſeiſed to them and their Succeſſors, this pleading is good, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma facie,</hi> 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 1.</p>

               <p>For the firſt exception I anſwer and confeſſe, that to alledge an Entry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Darrain continuance, without alledging an <hi>Ouſter</hi> of the Tenant, cannot abate the Writ, for the Defendant may enter to another intent as appeareth in the Commentaries, and with the aſſent of the Tenant; But here it was alledged that a Feoffment was made and a Livery which implies another.</p>
               <p>For the matter in Law, I conceive that the Water-courſe is extinguiſhed, and it may be compared to 21 E. 3. 2.

Now I will take ſome exceptions to the Declaration.</p>
               <p>1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Barkſedale</hi> ſaid, that the preſcription is well laid, and that he would prove by 39 <hi>H</hi> 6. 32. and 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. and <hi>per curiam</hi> the preſcription is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and albeit it is not ſaid, that it is <hi>Antiquae Rectoria,</hi> yet it is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Mich.</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> at <hi>Reading</hi> Term in <hi>Broek</hi> and <hi>Harris</hi> caſe, he doth not ſay, that it was <hi>Antiquum Meſſuage,</hi> and yet reſolved good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge,</hi> the caſe of 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. differs in this point from this caſe, for a Rectory ſhall alwaies be intended ancient, and ſo is not a Park, for this may be newly created: and he put this caſe; ſuppoſe I have a Mill, and I have a Water-courſe to this in my own land, and I ſell the Land, I cannot ſtop the Water-courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crew</hi> chief Iuſtice ſeemed of opinion that the preſcription is gone, and that the better opinion in <hi>Dyer</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> hath alwaies been that the Incloſure is gone by unity of poſſeſſion, but yet the Water-courſe is matter of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge</hi> and <hi>Whitlock,</hi> the way is matter of election, but the courſe of water is naturall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice, There is great difference between a way and a water-courſe as to this purpoſe, for admit that this water-courſe, after that it had been in the Curtilage of the Plaintiff, goes further to the Curtilage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall not that other have the benefit of this water-courſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unity of poſſeſſion?

                  <hi>Doderidge,</hi> my opinion is, that the water-courſe is not extinguiſhed by the unity of poſſeſſion: But ſome conceived that he had declared his opinion in terror to the Defendant: And afterwards the ſame Term <hi>Barkſedale</hi> for the Plaintiff ſaid, that he had agreed the caſe before, and therfore would now only indeavour to anſwer ſome exceptions which had been taken to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
               <p>1. Exception hath been that no preſcription or cuſtom is made for this wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter-courſe, but only that <hi>Currere ſolebat &amp; conſuevit.</hi> But I conceive tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Declaration is good notwithſtanding this, becauſe the Plaintiff here doth not claim an intereſt in the Water-courſe, but in the Land in which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therfore it is good, and this appeareth by 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. the Prior of <hi>Lanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> caſe in a preſcription in a Market overt generally, and the reaſon there was, becauſe he was a ſtranger, as in our caſe he is, and this pleading ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth alſo to be good by <hi>Cooks</hi> Book of Entries, 18. <hi>Smiths</hi> caſe, which was entred 9 <hi>Jac.

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremy</hi> for the Defendant; And firſt for the matter in Law, it ſeemed to him that by the unity of poſſeſſion the Water-courſe is extinguiſhed, and the Water-courſe may well be compared to the caſe of the way, for as a way is a paſſage for men over the land, ſo water hath paſſage upon the land, and a way is extinguiſhed by unity, as appeareth by 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4, 5. 21 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> and <hi>Davies Reports</hi> 5. and in 4 <hi>Jac. Jordan,</hi> and caſe it was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion that a way was extinguiſhed by unity of poſſeſſion; true it is, that there <hi>Popham</hi> chief Iuſtice put the difference, where the way is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and where not, for where the way is of neceſſity there it ſhall not be extinguiſhed: This caſe hath been compared to the caſe of a Warren in 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but I conceive that the caſes are not a like, becauſe a Warren is a meer liberty, 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. A man may have a Warren in his own Land, and <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Buts</hi> caſe by a Feoffment of Land, a Warren doth not paſſe, but this Water-courſe hath its originall out of the Land, and this caſe cannot be compared to an ancient Water-courſe running to a Mill, for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unity it ſhall paſſe with the Mill, for otherwiſe it ſhall not be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendinum aquatinum,</hi> ſo that the water there is parcell of the thing, and ſo of neceſſity ought to paſſe with the thing, but here it doth not appear that it is a Water-courſe of neceſſity, and for any thing that appeareth, it may be filled with another Water-courſe: Alſo I conceive that the Declaration is not good. 1. Becauſe neither preſcription nor cuſtom is laid for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, and it appeareth in <hi>Co. Book</hi> of Entries, <hi>Holcome</hi> and <hi>Evans</hi> caſe, and the old Book of Entries, 616, 617. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1. <hi>Car.

The Declaration is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient being an action upno the caſe for the ſtopping of a Water-courſe, and it is not <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> nor <hi>Contra pacem, Co. lib.</hi> 9. 50. the Earl of <hi>Shrewsburies</hi> caſe, when there are two cauſes of an action upon the caſe; the one <hi>Cauſa cauſans,</hi> the other <hi>Cauſa cauſata, cauſa cauſans</hi> may be alledged <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> for this is not the immediate cauſe of the action, but <hi>Cauſa cauſata F. N. B.</hi> 86. <hi>H.</hi> and 92. <hi>E.</hi> in the end of the Writ of action upon the caſe ſhall be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra pacem.</hi> 3. Alſo he hath preſcribed for the Tenants of the Rectory, which is not poſſible, for no Lay-man could be Tenant of a Rectory, or of Tithes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and therfore I pray Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitlock</hi> chief Iuſtice conceived that the declaration was good, &amp; the bar is naught, both for the form &amp; matter: the queſtion here is of <hi>Aqua profluens,</hi> and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53226:90"/>
I conceive that there needs no preſcription or cuſtome in this caſe, for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath its naturall courſe, and as is obſerved by <hi>Brudnell</hi> in 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſua deſcendit,</hi> it may be called <hi>Uſu captio,</hi> or Vſage, and he conceived that the action upon the caſe very well lies in this caſe, like to the caſe where a man bath a houſe and windows in it, and another erect a new houſe and ſtop the light, then I may have an action upon the caſe; but true it is, that I ſhall not only count for the loſſe of the aire, but alſo I ought to preſcribe that time out of mind light have entred by theſe windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. If there be a School-maſter in a Town, and another erect a new School in the ſame Town, an action upon the caſe doth not lye againſt him, becauſe Schools are for the publike benefit, and every private man may have a School in his houſe. And for the exception, that a Lay man cannot be poſſeſſed of a Rectory, I conceive that the Declaration is good notwithſtanding, for a Lay-man may have a Rectory by Demiſe.</p>
               <p>And for the Plea in bar, it is not good for the form, becauſe that <hi>Searles</hi> entred and enfeoffed <hi>Pigot,</hi> and it is not ſaid, that he entred, and <hi>Expulit,</hi> and if a man enter and make a Feoffment, the owner being upon the Land the Feoffment is void, and therfore an actuall Ouſter ought to be ſhown: And for the matter in Law, he conceived that the Bar was not good, for by the unity of poſſeſſion the water-courſe is not extinguiſhed, and yet I agree the caſes of a way and common upon the differences of Rights which are put in <hi>Bracton, lib</hi> 4. 221. Theſe are called <hi>Servitutes,</hi> as <hi>jus eundi, fodendi, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riendi, &amp;c. ſunt ſervitutes quas praedia ex quibus exunt aliis praediis debent,</hi> and are called <hi>Servitutes praediales,</hi> and this began by private right, <hi>to wit,</hi> by grant or preſcription.</p>
               <p>A way or common ſhall be extinguiſhed, becauſe they are part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Land, and the ſame Law is of Fiſhings alſo, but in our caſe the water-courſe doth not begin by the conſent of parties, nor by preſcription, but <hi>Ex jure naturae,</hi> and therfore ſhall not be extinguiſhed by unity: A War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren is not extinguiſhed by unity, becauſe a man may have a Warren in his own Land, and in the caſe of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. the Gutter was not extinguiſhed only by the unity of poſſeſſion, but there alſo appeareth in the caſe that the Pipes were deſtroyed, wherby it could not be revived, and although the Book of 13 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 295. Two Cloſes adjoyn together, the one being by preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bound to a Fence, the owner of the one purchaſe, the other dies, having iſſue two Daughters, who make partition, it is a <hi>quaere</hi> whether the incloſure be revived, yet I conceive cleerly, that by unity of the poſſeſſion the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is deſtroyed, for fencing is not naturall, but comes by induſtry of men, and therfore by the unity it ſhall be gone, and ſo briefly with this diverſity he concluded that where the thing hath its being by preſcription, unity will extinguiſh it; but where the thing hath its being <hi>Ex jure naturae,</hi> it ſhall not be extinguiſhed, and therfore the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice agreed, that the Declaration is good, and that the Bar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is good in manner, but for the matter in Law it is not good.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt exception to the Declaration, I conceive it is good, albeit there wants a preſcription, and this is the ordinary of pleading, as appears in <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>Luttrels</hi> caſe, and in all the preſidents before cited.</p>
               <p>2. For the exception <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> he conceived this difference, where the act is a Treſpaſſe and a Nuſance, there it may be laid to be <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> but if it be a Nuſance only and not a Treſpaſſe, it is otherwiſe: as if I have a way over another mans Land, if a ſtranger dig in the Land ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I cannot have the way, now becauſe it is a Treſpaſſe to the Owner of the Soil, in my action upon the caſe againſt a ſtranger, I may have <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> but if the owner ſtop the way, there <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> ſhall not be in my action upon the caſe.</p>
               <p>For the third exception, becauſe he both not ſay, <hi>Ad Rectoriam ſpectandum,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53226:90"/>
but I conceive that it ſhall be intended <hi>ad Rectoriam impropriat,</hi> and ſo it appeareth.</p>
               <p>4. Where it is ſaid, Watering-courſe for his Tenants, I conceive it is good enough, being in an action upon the caſe where damages only are to be recovered: That the Bar alſo is good in form, for although the Tenant here be a Diſſeiſor, yet it is a good Bar, for it matters not whether he hath a Title or no, if the Water-courſe be extinct by the unity, for the matter in Law, he conceived that the unity of poſſeſſion had not extinguiſhed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſe. A man hath things out of another mans Land, either by grant as a Seigniory, Rent, Common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe are diſtinguiſhed by unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe one who hath intereſt as Owner of the Land, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a particular intereſt in the ſame Land alſo. Or by preſcription, and thoſe things are extinguiſhed by unity of poſſeſſion alſo, and not only for the firſt reaſon becauſe he is Owner of the Land, and ſo cannot have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt in the ſame Land alſo, but alſo becauſe that by the unity the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription fail? And for the caſe in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> I conceive that by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the incloſure is gone, and ſo it was reſolved in 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for every one is not bound to incloſe: For the caſe of the way, I will ſuſpend my opinion concerning it, becauſe <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> caſe is now depending touching it in the ſame point.</p>
               <p>But now for our caſe, it differs from the other caſes, for the preſcription here is in another manner then is made for Common, for it ſhall be pleaded either as appendant, or appurtenant, but <hi>Currere ſolebat</hi> is only in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for here no intereſt is claimed, but in the other caſes an intereſt is claimed: In this caſe the Land remains as it was before, and therfore the unity will not extinguiſh it; and if ſuch a unity by conſtruction of Law ſhould extinguiſh Water-courſes, it would be too dangerous: for ſuppoſe that a man hath a Water-courſe from Thames to his houſe in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> if he purchaſe a parcell of Land in <hi>Hendley;</hi> now becauſe that the Thames come by the ſame Land, his Water-courſe ſhall be extinguiſhed. Alſo ſuppoſe that the Water-courſe after it hath been in the Curtilage of the Plaintiff, goes into another Curtilage, is it reaſon that by this unity the ſecond man ſhall loſe his Water-courſe? without doubt it is unreaſonable. And the caſe of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. of the Gutter, warrants this opinion, and therfore the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge</hi> Iuſtice, I conceive no great difficulty in the caſe; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the Declarations they are not materiall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there wants Preſcription or Cuſtom, I conceive that it is good enough, for here are the words of <hi>Currere ſolebat &amp; conſuevit,</hi> and <hi>Conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> is a good word for a Cuſtom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a Lay-man cannot have a Parſonage; true it is, that a Lay-man cannot be a Parſon, but he may have a Parſonage, for he may be Leſſee of it, which appeareth many times in our Books.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is not alledged to be <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> this is the moſt colourable exception, and the caſe and rule cited out of <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 9. the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> caſe is good Law, but it is impoſſible to plead <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> in this caſe, for the unity was in <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the wrong is ſuppoſed after the ſeverance, and it is ſuppoſed to be done by the Owner of the Land, and a man cannot do a thing upon his own Land <hi>Vi &amp; armis.</hi>

                  <hi>Crew</hi> chief Iuſtice, I agree that the Declaration is good, and alſo that the Bar is good for the manner, but for the matter in Law, I conceive that it is not good. In our Law every caſe hath its ſtand or fall from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon or circumſtance: For a Warren, and Tithes they are not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by unity, becauſe they are things collaterall to the Land: And for the caſe of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dyer,</hi> of an Incloſure; I conceive that by the unity the Incloſure is deſtroyed, for the Preſcription was interrupted, and in <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Drakes</hi> caſe, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> in this Court it was adjudged that in the ſame caſe the Preſcription was gone; It may be reſembled to the caſe of <hi>Homage Anceſtrell</hi> 57 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitzherbert Nuſans:</hi> And for our caſe it is not like to the caſes of Common, or a Way, becauſe the Water-courſe is a thing naturall and therfore by unity it ſhal not be diſcharged; alſo there is a linement out of which every man ſhall have a benefit, and therfore he concluded that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given for the Plaintiff; And Iudgment was commanded to be entred for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <head>The ſame Term in the ſame Court. Welden verſus Veſey.</head>
               <p>AN action of Debt was brought by <hi>Welden</hi> Sheriff of the City of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> againſt <hi>Veſey,</hi> upon the Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. and declares, that it is provided by this Statute that no Sheriff or Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall take for an execution, if the ſumm doth not exceed 100 <hi>l.</hi> but 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> and being above the ſumm of 100 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> and ſhews that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſaid <hi>Veſey</hi> had judgment againſt one in an action of Debt, that the Plaintiff by virtue of a <hi>Capias</hi> directed to him, took the body of the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon condemned, and that it was delivered to the Plaintiff, and that he for levying of the money had brought this action.</p>
               <p>The Defendant by way of Bar ſaith, that it is provided by this act that it ſhall not extend to Executions in Towns Corporate, and that this was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Coventry,</hi> and ſo demurred upon the Declaration.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Whitwick</hi> argued for the Plaintiff; two things are conſiderable in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether where the ſumm exceeds 100 <hi>l.</hi> the Sheriff ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for that which is over, or 6 <hi>d.</hi> only for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> for all the ſumm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether this Statute extend to Iudgments in Towns Corporate. For the firſt, the letter of the Statute is cleer that he ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for the reſidue, for the Statute is, that if it be above 100 <hi>l.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Whether a Sheriff, or, &amp;c. ſhall have</hi> 12 <hi>d. in the pound for the firſt</hi> 100<hi>l. and</hi> 6 <hi>d. for the reſt upon an Execution.</hi>
                  </note> that he ſhall have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> therfore if it be under a 100 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> And the meaning of the Statute is plain alſo, for otherwiſe the Sheriff ſhall have a leſſer Fee where it is above a 100 <hi>l.</hi> (as where it is a 199 <hi>l.)</hi> then he ſhall have for 100 <hi>l.</hi> but this was not the intent of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but the greater the Execution, the greater the Fee: It was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one <hi>Gores</hi> caſe, 10 <hi>Jac.</hi> that an action of Debt lies upon this Law, <hi>Paſch.</hi> 14 <hi>Jac. Rot.</hi> 351. <hi>Brole</hi> and <hi>Tumblerſon</hi> Sheriffs of the City of <hi>London,</hi> brought Dabt againſt <hi>Nathanael Michell</hi> for execution of 400 <hi>l.</hi> for 12 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. ſcil.</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> for the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>1.</hi> after: But I confeſſe that the principall queſtion there was, whether an action of Debt lies for the money, and it was reſolved that it did, and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>2. To the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that this doth not extend to Fees in a Town Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whether this extend to executions which go out of Iudgments in this Court, or in the Common Pleas into Towns Corporate. The Statute ſhews that before that time the Sheriff had taken great Fees, which the Parliament conſidering, reſtrained them to a certainty; The words of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> are generall: Provided that this Act ſhall not extend to any Fees to be taken for any Execution within any City or Town Corporate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the words be generall, yet the expoſition ſhall be according to reaſon, as it is ſaid in <hi>Fulmerſton</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> caſe in <hi>Plow.</hi> Expeſition, ſhal be made againſt the words, if the words be againſt reaſon, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 7 38 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Broo. Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 6. The King ſhall have primer Seiſen of all Lands of his Tenant which he holds of him in <hi>Capite,</hi> but if one holds of the King in <hi>Capite,</hi> in <hi>Socage,</hi> he ſhall pay no primer Seiſen to the King, and this Statute ſhall have this intendment, that this <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhall extend only to Executions upon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given in Cities and Towns Corporate, and not where Iudgment is given in this Court, or the Common Pleas, and Executions are only there, and this ſeems to be a reaſonable conſtruction; Executions in Towns corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>to wit,</hi> Executions upon Iudgments given in Towns corporate. If the Sheriff make execution at the Town ſide he ſhal have for his fees as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute limits, &amp; therfore he ſhall have it if within the Town, &amp; if this ſhould not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53226:92"/>
be ſo, this miſchief would enſue, that preſently when an Execution iſſues out againſt a man, he wil ſhelter himſelf in a Town corporate, as in a Sanctuary, and the Sheriff will not do execution there, becauſe he ſhall not have ſo great a Fee for doing it as if it were in another place, and ſo execution (which is the life of the Law) ſhall be undone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jermy</hi> for the Defendant; and firſt, if the ſumm exceed <hi>a</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of all. It is conſiderable that at Common Law the Sheriff ought to do execution freely without any recompence. In <hi>Both</hi> and <hi>Sadlers</hi> caſe lately in this place, an action upon the caſe was brought by a Bailiff, that wheras a Warrant for taking ſuch a man was directed to him, the Defendant promiſed him 40 <hi>s.</hi> for his pains, he took the man and brought an action for the 40 <hi>s.</hi> and it was agreed that he ſhould not have it. The Law abhors that great Fees ſhall be given for executions, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 3. 7. in <hi>Heydons</hi> caſe: In the expoſition of the Statute three things are conſiderable.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What the Common Law was before the making of it.</item>
                  <item>2. What the miſchief was at the Common Law.</item>
                  <item>3. The remedy which the Statute gives.</item>
                  <item>4. The true reaſon of the remedy. The Common Law was, that the Sheriff ſhall not take any Fee for execution, <hi>Ergo</hi> now he ſhall take as ſmall a fee as may be, becauſe this is nigheſt to the common Law: And the firſt words are declarative what Fees he ſhall take; and the ſubſequent words affirmative what Fees they may now take, <hi>to wit,</hi> where the ſumm doth not exceed a 100 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> 14 <hi>Jac.</hi> It was objected, that the Sheriff is not bound to do execution before he hath his Fee, and then it was reſolved that he might have an action of Debt, and ſo it ſeems that the party is not bound to give levying money before that the execution be done, and otherwiſe, the party Plaintiff may be at great miſchief if the other be not taken: And it hath been agreed lately in the Common Pleas, that if the ſumm exceed 100<hi>l.</hi> he ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>l have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> And as to the ſecond point, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to maintain that the <hi>Proviſo</hi> extends to executions in Towns corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, although the Iudgments upon which the executions iſſue are given in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts, and this is the conſtant practiſe of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Iudges delivered their opinion, with a proteſtation, that they might recall them, if afterwards better reaſon appeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crew</hi> chief Iuſtice was of opinion that he ſhall have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> if the ſumm exceed 100 <hi>l.</hi> and the ſumm ſhall not be divided, but if the ſumm be under a 100 <hi>l.</hi> then 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> and this is the reaſon of the Law.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond point, although the Iudgment be given in the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Court, yet if the Sheriff does execution there, he ſhall have his levying money, and this is within the intention of the <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge,</hi> Iuſtice the firſt queſtion is upon the expoſition of the Statute, the ſecond upon the <hi>Proviſo;</hi> For the firſt two expoſitions may be made as hath been remembred, then we will enquire of the interpretation: This Statute was made for the benefit of Sheriffs, that as they are in hazard by taking of men, becauſe many times reſiſtance was made. 2. When the Sheriff had taken a man, and in the carriage of him to priſon he had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, an action upon the caſe did lye againſt the Sheriff, and when he had him in priſon, he ought to have great care in keeping of him, for an action lies againſt him if he eſcape: and therfore although on the one ſide there was a great miſchief by reaſon of great Fees that the Sheriff took for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo on the other ſide, the Law tendred Sheriffs in reſpect of the hazard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d care which they had of men in execution, and therfore the Law in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency provides that the Sheriff ſhall have a good Fee for execution, and alſo it provides againſt his extortion, and ſo it is indifferent between the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Sheriff and covetouſneſſe, and we are not to judge according
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53226:92"/>
to the intent, but according to the equity of the Law, for equality to prevent the covetouſneſſe of Sheriffs and the oppreſſion of the people; then in this caſe if he ſhall have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> for 200 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have no more for execution of 200 <hi>l.</hi> then if it were a 100 <hi>l.</hi> But I think this was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Act.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond point, I take it that this Statute did not extend to Suits within Towns corporate, and executions upon them, for they are not at any great trouble for doing of execution within their Towns, nor hazard: But if a Sheriff does execution in a Town corporate, then he ſhall have according to the Statute, for it may be that the Priſon is far diſtant. And I upon the ſuddain conceive that this <hi>Proviſo</hi> extends only to Towns corporate, which are Counties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice, three queſtions have been made upon this Statute.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the nature of the action which the Sheriff is to have upon this Statute, and for that it hath been many times reſolved that he ſhall have an action of Debt, for when a remedy is given by a Statute, and no action is given by the ſame Statute wherby the penalty ſhall be recovered, there he ſhall have an action of Debt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who ſhall have the Fee when the Sheriff makes a Warrant to a Bayliff of a liberty, the Bayliff of the liberty or the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of the ſecond queſtion is, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when one Sheriff makes the extent, and another Sheriff makes the <hi>Liberate,</hi> who ſhall have the Fee?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third queſtion hath been in debate in the Common Pleas, and there was ſome opinion that if the ſumm be above a 100 <hi>l.</hi> and under 200 <hi>l.</hi> that the Sheriff ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Sheriff ſhall have a leſſe for execution of 199 <hi>l.</hi> then he ſhall have for 100 <hi>l.</hi> But if it be above 200 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have 6 <hi>d. ab initio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My opinion on the ſuddain is, that for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> and for the reſidue he ſhall have 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> and the other ſhall not be altered.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond point, I hold that this <hi>Proviſo</hi> extends only to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments originally commenced in Towns corporate, and not to executions upon Iudgments given in ſuperior Courts, for then the Sheriff does execution as an Officer to theſe Courts: And the Sheriff of the County is at as great pains, as if he were Sheriff of another County, and ſhall not be bound by the <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitlock</hi> Iuſtice was for the Plaintiff in both the points, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the Sheriff ſhall have 1 <hi>s.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the reſidue. And by him the Sheriff may refuſe to do execution untill the levying money be paid to him.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond point, the Sheriff of the County of the City is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> but ſhall have the Fees by the Statute provided, as well as the Sheriff of the County ſhall have, for the words are generall, and the exception goes to all Towns corporate and Cities, but doth not ſay Cities which are Counties, and therfore this Sheriff is within the benefit of this Law: And in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term next following the caſe was moved again by <hi>Whitlock</hi> for the Plaintiff, and he ſaid, that he would not ſpeak to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, becauſe the Court had delivered their opinion, that the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Statute, that this ſhall not extend to executions in Towns corporate, it is to be intended of executions in Towns corporate upon Iudgments there given: But for executions there upon Iudgments given in this Court, or any other ſuperior Court, the Sheriff ſhall have ſuch Fees as are limited by this Statute. And the Court ſaid to him that were agreed of it.</p>
               <p>And as for the firſt point, he conceived that the Sheriff ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for levying of every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> of every pound more, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53226:93"/>
this appears cleerly by the Letter of the Statute: And the caſe in <hi>Mich.</hi> 19 <hi>Jac.</hi> in <hi>C. B.</hi> between <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Bathirſt</hi> doth not make againſt it, for the reſolution of the ſaid caſe was upon other matters: The caſe being, a man was bound in a Statute of 120 <hi>l.</hi> the Sheriff extends, and before the <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> takes double Bond of the party for payment of his Fees, and afterwards brought Debt againſt the party, who pleads the ſaid matter in Bar, and the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. And in the caſe were three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Sheriff may take a double Bond for the payment of his Fees, and it was reſolved that the Bond was void, for the Sheriff might have Debt upon the Statute for his Fees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the Sheriff ſhall have his Fees before the <hi>Liberate,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that he ſhall not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Was this very queſtion, and two Iuſtices were againſt one, that where the ſumm exceed 100 <hi>l.</hi> he ſhall have but 6 <hi>d.</hi> for levying of every 20 <hi>s,</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> But the Iudgment was given upon the other points. All the Court ſeemed to be of opinion that he ſhall have 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the firſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the reſidue.</p>

Action upon the caſe doth not lye for theſe words, <hi>Thou art a corrupt man,</hi> if there were no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation touching his Profeſſion; And it was argued for the Plaintiff that the words were actionable, for it lyeth for theſe words, <hi>Thou art an Out-putte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> if they were ſpoken in <hi>Northumberland</hi> where they are underſtood, but not here, becauſe they have no ſignification: And the words here are ſpeciall and ſhall have reference to his Office, and ſhall have ſuch an interpretation as is now uſed, and now Knave hath no ſignification of Male-child.</p>

                  <hi>GOodwin</hi> brought an action upon the caſe againſt <hi>Joane Willoughby</hi> wife of <hi>Thomas Willoughby,</hi> and upon <hi>non Aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, it being found for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arreſt of Iudgment. 1. That the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhews that <hi>Thomas Willoughby</hi> was indebted upon account, and doth not ſhew that <hi>Joane Willoughby</hi> is Executrix or Adminiſtratrix, and yet that ſhe promiſed to pay, wheras in truth ſhe hath no cauſe to pay, for there is no conſideration, and ſo <hi>Nudum pactum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jermy</hi> for the Plaintiff: for the firſt, becauſe it doth not appear for what cauſe he accounted; I anſwer, that this is but a meer conveyance: And for the ſecond, that ſhe does not ſuppoſe that the Feme is executrix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here is a good conſideration, which is, that ſhe ſhall not ſue or moleſt, and that he gave day for payment, this is a ſufficient conſideration. But <hi>Stone</hi> of counſell with the Defendant ſaid, that the firſt is the ground of the action, and therfore he ought to ſhew for what he accounted.</p>

                  <hi>Crew</hi> chief Iuſtice, two exceptions have been taken, 1. For the alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of the account, which I conceive is good enough, and he need not ſhew the cauſe of the account: And as to the ſecond, becauſe it doth not appear that ſhe is Executrix, or Adminiſtratrix, and ſo no conſideration, and ſo no <hi>Aſſumpſit:</hi> But here ſhe aſſumes to be Debtor and makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to pay, which is an acknowledgment of the Debt by inference, and therfore he conceived that the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> was good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge</hi> Iuſtice, for the firſt it is good enough, yet <hi>Cum indebitatus exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit</hi> is no good <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> but here he ſhows a ſpeciall way of Debt, and it would be long and tedious to deſcribe his account. For the ſecond there is no cauſe of action, becauſe it doth not appear that ſhe is Executrix or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratrix, or Executrix of her own wrong.</p>
               <p>If I ſay to one do not trouble me, and I will give you ſo much, this is not actionable, for there ought to be a lawfull ground, and for this cauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration <note place="margin">Where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance without cauſe of action, is no ground of an Aſſumpſit.</note> is void, for it is only to avoid moleſtation: Give me time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is no good <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> for forbearance is no ground of action where he hath no cauſe to have Debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice agreed in the firſt with them, becauſe a generall action upon the caſe ſufficeth, and in truth it is but an inducement to the action; but for the other part he doubted, and he cited one <hi>Withypools</hi> caſe, an Infant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age, promiſed to pay certain money, he makes an Executor and dies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age; the Executor ſaith to him to whom the promiſe is made, forbear and I will pay you, and there an action upon the caſe did lye againſt the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor upon this promiſe, and yet it was a void Contract, but there was colour of action, forbear till ſuch a time, now the other hath loſt the advantage of his Suit: But he gave no opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crew,</hi> It is a violent preſumption that he is indebted: But by <hi>Doderidge</hi> here is no colour to charge her, but only by inference that ſhe is Executrix.</p>
               <p>If a ſtranger ſaith, forbear ſuch a Debt of <hi>J. S.</hi> and I will pay it, it is a good conſideration for the loſſe to the Plaintiff, and in this caſe it appears not that there is any cauſe, and <hi>Broom</hi> Secondary ſaid, that <hi>Withypools</hi> caſe before cited was reverſed in the Exchequer Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> If an Infant makes a promiſe, it is void, and he may plead <hi>non Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit,</hi> which <hi>Doderidge</hi> did not deny: But upon his Obligation he cannot plead <hi>Non eſt factum,</hi> for he ſaid that he ſhall be bound by his hands, but not by his mouth.</p>

               <p>By the Court an Inne in <hi>London</hi> is an Inne, and if a Gueſt be robbed in ſuch an Inne, he ſhall have remedy as if he were <hi>Enns per patriam:</hi> But the cheife point was, whether the maſter ſhall have the action in the caſe where the Servant loſt the goods, and by <hi>Jones Juſtice</hi> in 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>C.

               <p>3. The Plaintiff hath averred in his Declaration, that he hath lived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, and then he cannot have children by his ſervant <hi>Agnes,</hi> and then the words are not actionable.</p>
               <p>And 4. For ſaying he hath killed them is not actionable, and upon this he cited one <hi>Snags</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 4. who brought an Action for theſe words, <hi>Thou haſt killed thy Wife;</hi> and it appeared by the Declaration, that his Wife was alive, and therefore it was reſolved, that the words were not actionable.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt exception, it was ſaid by <hi>Aſhley</hi> Serjeant on the other ſide, that albeit the Plaintiff hath averred in his Declaration, that he lived continently, and ſo in a manner confeſſed that he had no children, this is but for the aggravation of the offence of the Defendant: as when an Action is brought for calling one Thiefe, he avers that he lived honeſtly, and yet the Action will lye. But I confeſſe if the Plaintiff had averred that he never had any child, then it would be like to <hi>Snags</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>a.</hi> and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would not lye.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Anne Davyes</hi> Caſe, there ſhe averred, that ſhe was a Virgin of good fame, and frée from all ſuſpition of incontinency; and the Defendant ſayd that a Grocer had got her with child: <hi>Owen Wards</hi> Caſe in <hi>Cook,</hi> Book of <hi>Entries</hi> hath the ſame Declaration as this, and it was the Preſident thereof. But <hi>Jermy</hi> moved another exception upon theſe words, <hi>he hath killed them,</hi> and doth not ſay Felony, which is not good, for he migt kill them in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iuſtice, which is juſtifiable, <hi>Trin.</hi> 2. <hi>Jac.

               <p>And <hi>Trin.</hi> 20. <hi>Jac.</hi> It was reſolved that theſe words <hi>(Agnes Knight is a Witch)</hi> were not Actinable: but it was anſwered of the other ſide. that upon the whole frame of theſe words, they cannot be intended but to be ſpoken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly, and there can be no pretenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Caſe was this, One <hi>Parcevall Sherwood</hi> was indebted to <hi>Suſan Clarke,</hi> who brought an Action of debt, by a Bill of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which is in nature of a Writ of Treſpas againſt him, and <hi>Sherwood</hi> upon a mean Proces was arreſted by the Defendant (being Bayliff of the Liberty of <hi>White-Chappel)</hi> and being in his cuſtody, he ſuffered him to eſcape: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Suſan Clarke</hi> made the Plaintiff her Executor, and dyed, and then the Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Caſe againſt the Defendant upon the ſaid eſcape; and upon iſſue joyned, it was found for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Calthrop</hi> of Councel with the Plaintiff, moved, that the Action will well lye, for the Teſtator himſelfe might have had either an Action of Debt, or upon the caſe upon the ſayd Eſcape, and therefore the Executor may have the ſame remedy, and that by the equity of the Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. which gives an Action to Executors <hi>pro bonis aſportatis in vita Teſtatoris,</hi> And by 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. this Statute ſhall be taken by equity, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who are in the ſame miſchiefe ſhall have the ſame remedy, albeit they be not named in the Statute, old <hi>Nat.

An Executor ſhall have a Replevin of Goods taken <hi>in vita Teſtatoris,</hi> and it hath been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſolved, that an Executor ſhal have a Trover and Converſion of Goods taken and converted in <hi>vita Teſtator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doderidge,</hi> demanded of him the reaſon why an Action upon the Caſe upon an Eſcape in the life of the Teſtator, ſhould not lye againſt an Executor, to which he anſwered, becauſe it was a meer perſonall wrong. <hi>Doderidge,</hi> ſo is the wrong here; and he ſaid that an Executor cannot have an action <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> for a treſpas done in <hi>vita Teſtator,</hi> and in this caſe becauſe the eſcape was in <hi>vita Teſtator,</hi> it is a perſonall wrong to him, for which the Executor ſhall not have an action upon the caſe.</p>
               <p>But it had been otherwiſe, if the eſcape had been after the death of the Teſtator, and the Statute of 7. <hi>E.</hi> 3. doth not extend to it, becauſe this Statute is only for Goods, but I agree to the caſe of Trover and Converſion. <hi>Jones Juſtice,</hi> If this action upon the caſe will not lye by the Executor, it would be a miſchievous caſe, for as ſoon as the Creditor dies, the Goalor will and may ſuffer the Priſoner to eſcape, becauſe none can have an action againſt him, but as it appeareth by the Caſe of 15. <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe is as miſchievous for the Creditor, if the Goalor ſuffers an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and dyes, for there no action lyes againſt the Executors. And for the caſe of <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> I agree to it, and ſo it was reſolved in <hi>Brokesbyes</hi> Caſe, 31. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that an <hi>Executor</hi> ſhall have a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> for a diſturbance made in <hi>vita Teſtator,</hi> if the avoydance be a Chattel veſted, and therefore within the equity of the Statute, which gives an action <hi>de bonis Teſtator,</hi> and he was commanded to move it another time.</p>
               <p>And at another day in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> next after, <hi>Grigs</hi> ſaid for the Defendant, that the <hi>Executor</hi> cannot have this action for an eſcape in <hi>vita Teſtator,</hi> becauſe it is a meer perſonall action given to the Teſtator, <hi>&amp; moritur cum perſona,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53226:100"/>
and cited 15. <hi>Eliz. Dyer, Whitakers</hi> Caſe, and that it is meerly perſonall appeareth by 10. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 271. Where an Executor ſhall not be charged with an aſcape <hi>in vita teſtator,</hi> generally, where not guilty is a good Plea, there an Action doth not lye for it againſt Executors. And this Caſe is not within the equity of the Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But it hath been objected that an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> is within the equity of this Statute for the Executors to have it 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. but the reaſon there, is, becauſe it is to recover the Term it ſelfe; and not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mages only: and upon the ſame reaſon an Action of Covenant, upon a Covenant broken in the life of the Teſtator, is maintainable by an Executor, and that alſo is the reaſon of the Caſe of the <hi>Qua: impedit,</hi> becauſe there the preſentation is to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but in our Caſe damages only are to be recorded upon the eſcape, and ſo they are not alike.</p>
               <p>2. The Arreſt here is upon mean Proces, and upon a Bill of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which is but in nature of a Treſpaſſe before Declaration, and I conceive that if one be taken by a <hi>Cap: ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> at the ſute of one, albeit the party at whoſe Suit he is taken, dyes, yet he ſhall be detained in execution, but I conceive the Law to be otherwiſe upon a <hi>Cap: ad reſpondend:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Plaintiff ſaith, that the Arreſt was, <hi>ea intentione,</hi> to declare againſt him in an Action of Debt, yet an intent is a ſecret thing, and albeit the Executor repreſent the perſon of the Teſtator, yet he cannot follow it, and it is impoſſible to prove the intent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jermy</hi> for the Plaintiff ſaid, that there is a difference, where an Action is brought by, and where againſt Executors, and this appeareth by <hi>Littletons</hi> Caſe, that an Action of account doth not lye againſt Executors for want of privity as to that purpoſe, but it is cleer that account lies by Executors, becauſe this is a point of intereſt: And here in this Caſe, the Teſtator had intereſt in the body by the arreſt, and this appeareth in <hi>Hichcocks</hi> Caſe, cited in <hi>Hargraves</hi> Caſe in the Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> 5. Report, and by the Arreſt the body of the party is as a Chattel in the Teſtator: and he compared this to the caſe of 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> Executors 52. An Executor ſhall have a raviſhment of ward for a taking in the time of the Teſtator.</p>
               <p>And 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. and a Caſe cited by <hi>Hankford,</hi> that if one enter upon a Statute Merchant, who dyes, his Executor ſhall have an aſſize, and therefore I conceive, that if a Tenant by <hi>Elegit</hi> be ouſted and bring an Aſſize, if the Executors be cuſted again, he ſhall have a rediſſeiſen upon the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſter, becauſe the Intereſt continues in him which was in the firſt Teſtator, and it is to be obſerved in our law, that the Law inlargeth it ſelfe to give to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors the ſame remedy which the Teſtator had, and thereupon he cited <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 6. 80. <hi>a. &amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> 301.</p>
               <p>And in our Caſe the body of the party was in the Teſtator, as a gage till appearance, ſo that it was not only a perſonall tort. for he had an intereſt, and this appeareth by <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 5. 27. by a Caſe put in <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Caſe there, and if the Executors ſhall not in this Caſe have an Action, it would be very miſchievous. for ſo the Goalor ſhall ſuffer eſcapes diſpuniſhable, 20. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. Executors</hi> 74.</p>
               <p>But as to this reaſon it was anſwered by <hi>Jones Juſtice,</hi> that the ſame miſchiefe is of the other ſide, if the Goaler ſuffer an eſcape and dies, and Action lies not againſt his executors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calthrop</hi> on the ſame ſide cited <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 121. <hi>a.</hi> that a man condemned in debt, and impriſoned, if the Goalor ſuffer him to eſcape, the Party, or his Executor may have debt againſt the Goalor: And he ſaid, that at Common Law, Debt lay againſt a Goalor upon an eſcape, as appeares in <hi>Fitz.</hi> Debt 127. 38. <hi>H. C. placit</hi> 36. And if it were a debt in the Teſtator, then Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors may have an Action upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:53226:100"/>
But by <hi>Doderidge</hi> Iuſtice in the ſaid caſe, debt lies not at Common-Law, for to what purpoſe was the Statute made? But for the point in Queſtion, his ſudden opinion, was, the Executor ſhall have this Action, and that it is within the equity of the Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. for it is a wrong, although it were upon meane Proces, and the tort continues as to the Executor, for every thing which makes to the hinderance of the Execution of the will, is wrong to him, and the performance of Wills is much favoured, becauſe it is the laſt deſire of the Partie who is dead, and it is for the publick-weale, becauſe by this means debts ſhall be payd.</p>
               <p>And many caſes are within the equity of the Statute, that are not within the letter, as thoſe Caſes which have been put, all which he agreed: <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice on the ſudden was againſt it, and that this Caſe is not within the equity of the Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>There are divers Actions which are not helped by this Statute, as Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe for cutting of Trees, Battery, and the like; for the Statute is, <hi>de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis &amp; Catallis aſportat in vita teſtator:</hi> An Executor ſhall have a <hi>Replevin</hi> of Goods taken <hi>in vita teſtator,</hi> for by this he recovers the thing it ſelfe, and ſhall have <hi>Detinue,</hi> but ſhall not have tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>paſſe, for he cannot puniſh the wrong done in the life of the Teſtator.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is much inlarged by equity, as the caſes which have been put, and extend alſo to uſurpation in the life time of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as appears in <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Caſe <hi>Co. lib,</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33. <hi>Eliz. in C. B.</hi> in the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſters</hi> caſe, that if the Teſtator dyes within 6 months after the uſurpation, the Executor ſhall have a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> And the Caſe of Trover and Converſion <hi>in vita Teſtator,</hi> was maintained by Executors, and it was ſo reſolved 41. and 42. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Counteſſe of <hi>Rutlands</hi> Caſe in both the Benches, becauſe this is in nature of a Writ of Deti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
               <p>Now for the Caſe in queſtion, I conceive that it is not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. becauſe it is neither <hi>bona</hi> nor <hi>catalla. Whitlock</hi> Iuſtice <hi>contra,</hi> and that this Statute is very much taken by equity, <hi>&amp; praeter lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> though not <hi>contra literam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Nota,</hi> that all agreed, if it were upon an eſcape after Iudgement, that the Action would lie by the Executors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the Caſe of <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 121. <hi>a.</hi> But the principall Caſe was adjourned.</p>
               <p>And afterwards <hi>Trin.</hi> 3. <hi>Car.</hi> It was argued again by <hi>Jermy</hi> for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and the ſole point was, A man taken by <hi>latitat.</hi> and being in the cuſtody of the Sheriff eſcape, the Party at whoſe ſuit he was arreſted dies, whether his Executor ſhall have an Action upon the Caſe upon the Eſcape, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he might.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, that it is a perſonall wrong, and as an Action doth not lye againſt Executors upon an Eſcape, <hi>in vita Teſtator,</hi> ſo not by Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: To which I anſwer, that it is not meerly perſonall, but mixed with an intereſt.</p>
               <p>At the Common-Law, an Executor could not have treſpas for Goods taken <hi>in vita Teſtator,</hi> but yet he ſhould have a Replevin, 34. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz.

So at Common-Law, a Succeſſor ſhould not have Treſpas, for Goods carried away in the life time of his Predeceſſor, but he ſhall have a Replevin, 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25, but this was remedied by the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge cap.</hi> 28. and ſo upon the Statute of 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>de bonis aſportat &amp;c.</hi> Trover and Converſion hath beene adjudged within the ſaid Statute, for the Statute hath alwayes been liberally expounded. 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Fitz,</hi> Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor 52.

               <p>UPon an Information by <hi>Heath</hi> the Kings Attorney, againſt two men of the County of <hi>Huntington</hi> in the name of all the County, that they ought, and uſed to repaire the Bridge of S. <hi>Eedes</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Huntington,</hi> Iſſue was joyned by the County, whether they ought and uſed to repaire this Bridge; and the Attorney gave no evidence, but put it upon the other ſide, for he ſaid by the Statute of 22. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> if it doth not appeare that any particular perſon, or Towne ought to repaire a Bridge, by reaſon of Tenure, or otherwiſe, that then the County where this is, ought to repaire it.</p>

               <p>And alſo they found that the County of <hi>Huntington</hi> ought to repaire all, but not that they uſed to repaire it: And at another day <hi>Hedley</hi> Serjeant moved for the County, that the Verdict was not good, becauſe the iſſue was, whether they ought to repaire, and <hi>a tempore cujus contrarium &amp;c.</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Attorney anſwered, that for the firſt exception the caſe of 27. <hi>Aſſ. Pl.</hi> 8. is againſt it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Father made a Leaſe to one (under whom the Plaintiff claims) for three lives, rendring the ancient Rent, excepting all the trees (unleſſe thoſe which ſhall be for cropping, lopping, and fewell) <hi>Henry</hi> the Father dyes, <hi>John</hi> the Son in the next remainder cut certain trees <hi>Victorin, Secheverell</hi> who clayms by the leaſe made by the Father, brings treſpas, and two Queſtions were moved.</p>

A man makes a Leaſe for life without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of waſte, a Stranger cuts trées, the Leſſée brings treſpas, he ſhall recover no Damages for the value of the trees, becauſe the propriety belongs to him in the reverſion, &amp; he may diſpoſe of them, <hi>Quaere Dyer</hi> 284. <hi>Daunſley</hi> and <hi>Southwels</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Lewys Bowles</hi> caſe, that ſuch a Leſſee may take trées which are blown down, and 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 45. <hi>Mich</hi> 41. and 42. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>2. The exception is voyd for another reaſon, becauſe when ſuch a Leſſée, makes ſuch a Leaſe, this is not his Leaſe, but it hath its operation out of the originall fine, and he who makes this hath but the nomination, and therefore cannot adde a condition or exception to it. And if the ſecond Leaſe ſhall have its being out of the eſtate of the Leſſee for life, then there ſhall be an uſe upon an uſe, as appears <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 1. 134. and that the Law will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and <hi>Co.

               <p>3. This caſe may be reſembled to the caſe of Copy-holds, which is in <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 8. 63. b. in <hi>Swaynes</hi> Caſe: If a Lord takes a Wife, and afterwards grants Lands by Copy, according to the cuſtome, and dyes, his Wife ſhall not be endowed of this Land, for albeit her title of Dower was before the Grant, yet the title of Copi-hold (which is the cuſtome) is elder then the title of Dower; ſo in our caſe, the title of the ſecond Leſſee is derived out of the eſtate of the Conuzées, and therefore ſhall not be clogg'd with the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Leſſee for life, without impeachment of waſte.</p>
               <p>4. This priviledge to cut the trées is annexed to the eſtates, and goes along with the eſtate, and therefore ſhall not begin before the Stranger be in poſſeſſion, 3. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 44. 45. <hi>Idles</hi> caſe 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 10. And it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the caſes of 16. <hi>E.</hi> 4. and 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Tenant in taile ſold the trées, if he dyes before the Party takes them, he ſhall never have them, becauſe he hath ſtayd out his time. But it may be objected that upon ſuch a Leaſe he may reſerve a rent, as it is in <hi>Whitlocks</hi> caſe <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 8. to which I will offer this difference, Leſſée for life, with power to make Leaſes for thrée lives, reſerving rent makes a Leaſe for thrée lives, reſerving rent, this reſervation is good, becauſe it is but a Declaration of the Leaſe, and of the rent; but if there were no ſuch clauſe of reſerving rent, then I conceive it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>But admitting all this were againſt me, yet the juſtification of the Defendant is not good, for by the exception out of the exception, the Leſſor
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53226:102"/>
cannot take the benefit of the bodies of the trées, becauſe he will thereby deprive the Leſſée of the croppings and loppings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in 28. <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 8. <hi>Dyer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leverell</hi> and <hi>Spynkes</hi> caſe. <hi>Mylward</hi> of <hi>Lincolnes Inne</hi> for the Defendant. And firſt he conceived that the Leſſée for life without impeachment of waſte, might diſpoſe of the trées in the ſame manner as Tenant in fée might doe, with this difference, that the diſpoſall thereof ought to be in his life time, and ſo it is reſolved in <hi>Lewys Bowles</hi> caſe <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 11. 46.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond matter in the caſe is, whether the Leſſée for life, without impeachment of waſte <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath only an authority, or an intereſt in the trées, and I conceive that he hath an intereſt, for his power is to make Leaſes of it, or of any part for 21. years or 3. lives, and that the Conuzors ſhall be ſeized to the uſe of ſuch Leſſées, now when he makes a Leaſe excepting the trées, the trées are not demiſed, ſo that he remains ſtill tenant for life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment of waſte for the trees.</p>
               <p>3. Excepting all Timber-trées, but for fencing, cropping, and lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; it hath béene objected that this exception hath no forme: It is a generall rule. that if a man makes a Grant, and in the cloſe thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all that which was granted before, the exception is voyd: and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by 34. <hi>Aſſ. Pl.</hi> 11. A Will was granted <hi>ſalvo ſtagno molendini:</hi> ſo here the laſt exception takes away all that which was granted before, 38. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38. in a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 19. by <hi>Mountague,</hi> the cropping and lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of trées belong to the Leſſee, like to the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> caſe in 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. and 13. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13. and 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. and albeit every grant ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt the Grantor, yet it ſhall have a reaſonable intendment for the benefit of the Grantor, and this appeares by 7. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 22. 17. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. 21. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 43. ſo here the Exception ſhall have a reaſonable intendment, that he ſhall onely have ſuch loppings and croppings as ſhall be beſtowed upon the Park, and no other. <hi>Doderidge</hi> Iuſtice, I conceive that by the words <hi>without impeachment of waſte,</hi> he hath intereſt in the trees as long as the eſtate continues.</p>
               <p>2. That when he makes a leaſe by the ſecond power given to him, this is derived out of the Fine, and ſhall be good againſt him in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe he hath power to diſpoſe of the trées, I conceive, that when he makes a Leaſe, excepting the trees, this is a good exception, 24. <hi>Eliz. C. B.</hi> A man made a Leaſe for years, now he hath the waſt of the trees, if he aſſign over his eſtate excepting the trées, the exception is voyd, but in our caſe the Leſſée hath not parted with his whole eſtate.</p>
               <p>4. So the ſole queſtion is, whether he in remainder may cut the trées du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the eſtate of thrée lives made by <hi>Henry Secheverell,</hi> and he conceived that he might, and ſo concluded for the Defendant: <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice agréed, that the Leſſee for life without impeachment of waſt, hath intereſt in the trées, but this intereſt is concomitant with his eſtate and determinable with it.</p>
               <p>2. I conceive that the exception is good. Such things which a man hath by the Law he cannot reſign to himſelfe upon his aſſignment, as the cropping and lopping of trées, as if tenant in taile after poſſibility <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (who is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable of waſt by fréedome of the Law) aſſign over his eſtate, reſerving the trees, he cannot cut the trees, but here the Leſſee hath a larger liberty then the Law gives to him, and he by vertue of this may give away the trees; but I conceive that if he had aſſigned over all his eſtate, then he could not have excepted the trees, but here he hath not granted over all his eſtate, for he hath a remainder, and may have an eſtate in poſſeſſion afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon this Leaſe for three lives hee may reſerve a rent to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:53226:103"/>
3. I conceive, that this Leaſe is derived partly out of his owne eſtate, and hee hath not the meere nomination, and partly out of the firſt Fine, and therefore ſuch Leſſees ſhall be ſubject to all charges made by the Tenant for life who made the Leaſe, as Statutes, Recognizances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, during the life of the firſt tenant for life.</p>
               <p>4. When he dyes who made the ſaid Leaſe for three lifes, whether he in remainder may cut the Trees during the ſaid Leaſe, and he conceived (yet not without ſome doubt) that he had no power during the lives of the ſayd Leſſees. <hi>Whitlock</hi> Iuſtice agreed with the reſt, ſo that it was agreed by all:</p>
               <p>1. That it is a good exception.</p>
               <p>2. That the ſecond leaſe is drawn out of the Fine: And the queſtion now is, whether he in remainder without impeachment of waſte with power to cut the trees, hath power to cut them, during the lives of the ſaid three Leſſees, and the Councell was commanded to ſpeake to this point only upon another day.</p>

               <p>IN debt upon an Obligation for performance of certain Covenants contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in certain Indentures made between the Parties aforeſaid, and the Covenant upon which the queſtion did ariſe was this: <hi>R. B.</hi> being ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. R. S.</hi> of the Mannor of <hi>Sale,</hi> they exchanged the one for the other, and the Mannor of <hi>R.

S.</hi> covenanted to pay for the ſaid Mannor 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and no time was limited when the money ſhould be payd, and the money not being payd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year after, <hi>R. B.</hi> bargained and ſold the ſaid Mannor by Deed indented, and inrolled to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his Heirs, and afterwards brought an Action of Debt againſt the ſaid <hi>R. S.</hi> for the ſaid 1200 <hi>l.</hi> who pleaded this mater in Bar, and <hi>Jermy</hi> argued for the Plaintiff, that this Plea ſhall not diſcharge the Defendant of the ſaid Covenant, for it is a reciprocall covenant, and he ought to ſue the other Party for the breach of the covenant; and it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bargain <hi>Dyer</hi> 30. 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 9. and here the Agreement is in writing, and it is good, albeit there be no limitation when the money ſhall be payd, 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Calthrop</hi> for the Defendant, that the Action could not ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for the contract is Executory, and therefore is not to pay the money till he hath the Mannor, for the Covenant is that <hi>pro Maner. &amp;c.</hi> he ſhould pay him 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and the word <hi>[pro]</hi> implies a condition and conſideration, and being excecutory on the one part, ſhall be alſo executory on the other part, 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 20. 21. <hi>Abridg. in Plowden</hi> 134. in <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſtons</hi> caſe 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. If <hi>A.</hi> grant to <hi>B.</hi> all the ancient Pale, and for them <hi>B.</hi> grants, that he will make new Pale for <hi>A.</hi> if <hi>B.</hi> cannot have the old Pale, he ſhall be excuſed from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the new Pale, for he cannot have the one without doing the other, 6. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer</hi> 75.

               <p>Alſo there is no time limited when the payment ſhall be made: true it is, that in <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 6. 30. when the act to be done is a tranſitory act, and no time is limited there, it ought to be done in convenient time, but the Law ſhall judge of the conveniency of this time, and the Law will never judge the time of payment to be before he hath the Mannor, <hi>pro quo. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many caſes when no time is limited, the Law will appoint a time, as appeareth in 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 48. and <hi>Perkins</hi> 799. But now in our caſe the Law will never appoint that this money ſhall be payd, becauſe the other party hath diſabled himſelfe to perform his part; like to Sir <hi>Anthony Maines</hi> caſe <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Doderidge,</hi> The bargain is not perfect, becauſe no day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is limited, and the other ſhall have no Action of Debt for the money before he hath the Mannor. <hi>Jones,</hi> If I covenant to make a Feoffment to <hi>J.

For the firſt it is agreed, that the Defendant ſhall pay 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and the Plaintiff agrees to make Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances for this Mannor, and that the Aſſurances ſhould be made as Councel ſhould deviſe, and I conceive that the Defendant ought to procure the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to deviſe, for mutuall Aſſurances ought to be made, and either party ought to appoint what Aſſurances he would have, and the one ought not to be a Carver to the other, neither can one know what councel the other will have, and upon this reaſon is the caſe, 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. 4. and <hi>Plow.</hi> 15. <hi>b.</hi> the Caſe of the Bell, it ſhall be weighed by him who is to have the profit, peradventure if it were in caſe of an Obligation to perform covenants, there he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Counſel, for ſaving the penalty of the obligation; but it is otherwiſe here in caſe of a Covenant, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>b.</hi> 18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27. and 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29.

               <p>2.

               <p>Alſo the Plaintiff did not ſhew in his Declaration what kinde of felony this was, and it may be ſuch a felony for which an Action will not lie; for there are divers kinds of felony, and a Mayhem is one kind, as appears in 40. <hi>Aſſ.
